                "title": "Proteomic analysis and functional validation reveal distinct therapeutic capabilities related to priming of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells with IFN-\u03b3 and hypoxia: potential  implications for their clinical use",
                "projectDescription": "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are a heterogeneous population of multipotent cells that can be obtained from various tissues, such as dental pulp, adipose tissue, bone marrow and placenta. MSCs have gained importance in the field of regenerative medicine because of their promising role in cell therapy and their regulatory abilities in tissue repair and regeneration. However, a better characterization of these cells and their products is necessary to further potentiate their clinical application. In this study, we used unbiased high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis to investigate the impact of distinct priming strategies, such as hypoxia and IFN-\u03b3 treatment, on the composition and therapeutic functionality of the secretome produced by MSCs derived from the amniotic membrane of the human placenta (hAMSCs). Our investigation revealed that both types of priming improved the therapeutic efficacy of hAMSCs, and these improvements were related to the secretion of functional factors present in the conditioned medium (CM) and exosomes (EXOs), which play crucial roles in mediating the paracrine effects of MSCs. In particular, hypoxia was able to induce a pro-angiogenic, innate immune response- activating, and tissue-regenerative hAMSC phenotype, as highlighted by the elevated production of regulatory factors such as VEGFA, PDGFRB, ANGPTL4, ENG, GRO-\u03b3, IL8, and GRO-\u03b1. IFN-\u03b3 priming, instead, led to an immunosuppressive profile in hAMSCs, as indicated by increased levels of TGFB1, ANXA1, THBS1, HOMER2, GRN, TOLLIP and MCP-1. Functional assays validated the increased angiogenic properties of hypoxic hAMSCs and the enhanced immunosuppressive activity of IFN-\u03b3-treated hAMSCs. This study extends beyond the direct priming effects on hAMSCs, demonstrating that hypoxia and IFN-\u03b3 can influence the functional characteristics of hAMSC-derived secretomes, which, in turn, orchestrate the production of functional factors by peripheral blood cells. This research provides valuable insights into the optimization of MSC-based therapies by systematically assessing and comparing the priming type-specific functional features of hAMSCs. These findings highlight new strategies for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, particularly in the context of multifactorial diseases, paving the way for the use of hAMSC-derived products in clinical practice.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "2 mL of conditioned medium or 10 \u03bcg of isolated exosomes from 344 differentially stimulated MSCs underwent filter aided sample preparation (FASP) with 10 kDa Vivacon 500 spin filters (Wisniewski et al., 2009). Briefly, proteins were reduced with 20 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and free cysteine residues were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide for 5 min at 37\u00b0C in the dark in UA (100 mM Tris/HCl 8 M urea pH 8.5) (Sigma Aldrich). After six washing steps with UB (100 mM Tris/HCl 8 M urea pH 8), proteins were digested with 0.3 \u03bcg LysC (Promega) in UC (25 mM Tris/HCl 2 M urea pH 8) for 16 h at 37\u00b0C followed by a second digestion step with 0.15 \u03bcg trypsin in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Promega) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C as previously described (Saveliev et al., 2013). The peptides were eluted into collection tubes and acidified with formic acid (Sigma Aldrich) at a final concentration of 0.1%. Afterward, proteolytic peptides were desalted by stop-and-go extraction (STAGE) with self-packed C18 tips (Empore) (Rappsilber et al., 2003). Peptides were eluted using 60% acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.1% formic acid. After vacuum centrifugation, peptides were concentrated and dissolved in 20 \u03bcL 0.1% formic acid. At this point, peptide concentrations were analyzed by a Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). A total amount of 1.2 \u03bcg was loaded per sample onto a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano LC system (Thermo Scientific) which was coupled online via a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Scientific) to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were separated on an Acclaim PepMap C18 column (50 cm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm ID, Thermo Scientific) with 250 Nl/min flow using a binary gradient of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) supplemented with 0.1% formic acid (2% B 0min,5%B5min,25%B185min,35%B230min,60%B250min, 95%B255min,95%B265min,2%B265min,2%B350min).Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was used for label-free quantification (LFQ). Full MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 70,000 (m/z range: 300\u20131400; automatic gain control (AGC) target: 1E+6; max injection time 50 ms). The DDA was used on the 10 most intense peptide ions per full MS scan for peptide fragmentation (resolution: 17,500; isolation width: 2 m/z; AGC target: 1E+5; normalized collision energy (NCE): 25%, max injection time: 120ms). A dynamic exclusion of 120 s was used for peptide fragmentation.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "The raw data were analyzed with the software MaxQuant, version 2.0.1.0 (maxquant.org, Max Planck Institute, Munich). The MS data were searched against a reviewed canonical FASTA database of Homo sapiens including isoforms from UniProt (download: November the 5th 2020). Trypsin/P was defined as a protease. Two missed cleavages were allowed for the database search. The option in the first search was used to recalibrate the peptide masses within a window of 20 ppm. For the main search peptide and peptide fragment mass tolerances were set to 4.5 and 20 ppm, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was defined as static modification. Protein N-terminal acetylation as well as oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. The false discovery rate for both peptides and proteins was adjusted to less than 1%. The \u201cmatch between runs\u201d option was enabled. LFQ of proteins required at least one ratio count of unique peptides. Unique and razor peptides were used for quantification. Data normalization was enabled. The protein LFQ reports from MaxQuant were further processed in Perseus (Tyanova et al., 2016).",

                "projectDescription": "Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for a substantial number of invasive infections globally each year. These infections are problematic because they are frequently recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic tolerance, the ability of bacteria to persist despite normally lethal doses of antibiotics, contributes to antibiotic treatment failure in S. aureus infections. To understand how antibiotic tolerance is induced, S. aureus biofilms exposed to multiple anti-staphylococcal antibiotics were examined using both quantitative proteomics and transposon sequencing. These screens indicated that arginine metabolism is involved in antibiotic tolerance within a biofilm and led to the hypothesis that depletion of arginine within S. aureus communities can induce antibiotic tolerance. Consistent with this hypothesis, inactivation of argH, the final gene in the arginine synthesis pathway, induces antibiotic tolerance. Arginine restriction was found to induce antibiotic tolerance via inhibition of protein synthesis. In murine skin and bone infection models, an argH mutant has enhanced ability to survive antibiotic treatment with vancomycin, highlighting the relationship between arginine metabolism and antibiotic tolerance during S. aureus infection. Uncovering this link between arginine metabolism and antibiotic tolerance has the potential to open new therapeutic avenues targeting previously recalcitrant S. aureus infections.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Mature colony filter biofilms inoculated and grown on TSA as above were transferred to TSA plates either without antibiotics or with vancomycin, ceftaroline, delafloxacin, or linezolid added. The colony filter biofilms were allowed to grow for an additional 48 hours, with transfer to a fresh plate containing the same antibiotic growth conditions after 24 hours. After 48 hours of antibiotic exposure, the filters containing the biofilms were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and frozen at -20\u00c2\u00b0C until protein extraction could be performed. In each experiment, three colony biofilm filters were pooled for each sample, and the experiment was repeated in triplicate. Protein extraction was performed by washing the filters in SA lysis solution (50 mM TrisHCL pH7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, Roche Complete protease inhibitors) and vortexing to separate the biofilm from the filters and resuspend the bacteria. The samples were washed once with SA lysis solution, and then resuspended in SA lysis solution with 40 \u00c2\u00b5g/ml of lysostaphin (AMBI Products) and incubated at 37\u00c2\u00b0C for 1 hour. Following lysostaphin digestion, IGEPAL (Sigma Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 1% and the samples were incubated on ice for 15 minutes prior to sonication. Following sonication, the cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube and stored at -20\u00c2\u00b0C prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.  LC-MS/MS. To generate quantitative proteomics data, proteins were solubilized with 5% SDS, 50mM TEAB (pH 7.6), incubated at 95\u00c2\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and sonicated at 20% amplitude. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce 660 Assay (Thermo Scientific), and equal amounts of protein were digested using S-traps (Protifi). Briefly, proteins were reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA), acidified using phosphoric acid, and combined with s-trap loading buffer (90% MeOH, 100mM TEAB).  Proteins were loaded onto s-traps, washed, and digested with Trypsin/Lys-C overnight at 37\u00cb\u0161C. Peptides were eluted and dried with a vacuum concentrator. Peptides were resuspended in H2O/0.1% formic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis.   Peptides were separated using a 75 \u00c2\u00b5m x 50 cm C18 reversed-phase-HPLC column (Thermo Scientific) on an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Thermo Scientific) with a 120-minute gradient (2-32% ACN with 0.1% formic acid) and analyzed on a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap instrument (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

                "projectDescription": "Among the diseases caused by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) abnormal activation by bacterial endotoxin, sepsis is the most dangerous one. The reprogramming of macrophages plays a crucial role in orchestrating the pathogenesis of sepsis. However, the precise mechanism underlying TLR4 activation in macrophages remained incompletely understood. Our studies revealed that upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, CREB-binding protein (CBP)  was recruited to the TLR4 signalosome complex and resulted in pronounced acetylation in the TIR domains of TLR4, Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and MyD88 adapter-like (MAL), which significantly enhanced the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and polarization of M1 macrophages. In sepsis patients, significantly elevated TLR4-TIR acetylation was detected in CD16+ monocytes combined with elevated expression of M1 macrophage markers and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) served as a key deacetylase in the deacetylation of the TIR domain complex. The inhibition of HDAC1 accelerated sepsis-associated syndromes, while the inhibition of CBP alleviated this process. Overall, our findings highlighted the crucial role of TIR domain complex acetylation in the regulation of inflammatory immune response and suggested that the reversible acetylation of the complex emerged as a promising therapeutic target for M1 macrophages during the progression of sepsis.",

                "projectDescription": "Microalgae are promising production platforms for the cost-effective production of recombinant proteins. We have recently established that the red alga Porphyridium purpureum provides superior transgene expression properties, due to the episomal main- tenance of transformation vectors as multicopy plasmids in the nucleus. Here, we have explored the potential of Porphyridium to synthesize complex pharmaceutical proteins to high levels. Testing expression constructs for a candidate subunit vaccine against the hepatitis C virus (HCV), we show that the soluble HCV E2 glycoprotein can be produced in transgenic algal cultures to high levels. The antigen undergoes faithful posttranslational modification by N-glycosylation and is recognized by conformationally selective antibodies, suggesting that it adopts a proper antigenic conformation in the endoplasmic reticulum of red algal cells. We also report the experimental determina- tion of the structure of the N-glycan moiety that is attached to glycosylated proteins in Porphyridium. Finally, we demonstrate the immunogenicity of the HCV antigen produced in red algae when administered by injection as pure protein or by feeding of algal biomass.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "In-gel protein digestion for mass-spectrometric (MS) analysis. Samples of 20 \u03bcg HCV antigen purified from algal cultures were separated by SDS-PAGE, the protein band of interest was excised, cut into small pieces, and washed with a solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) for 15 min. This washing step was repeated once. Reduction and alkylation were performed by incubation with 10 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 40 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37\u00b0C for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently, alkylated proteins were in-gel digested overnight by trypsin at a ratio of 20:1 (protein : trypsin) at 37\u00b0C under agitation. The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel by a series of washes with 30% to 70% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid. Prior to MS analysis, peptides were desalted on C18 membranes according to published procedures (16), dried by vacuum centrifugation and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. LC-MS analysis of glycopeptides. Peptides were redissolved in 2 % (v/v) acetonitrile / 0.1 % formic acid in ultrapure water and analyzed on an HPLC-MS system consisting of an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific), coupled via a nanospray source to a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating in positive ion mode. For N-glycopeptide analysis, an In-Source Collision Induced Dissociation (IS-CID) voltage of 80 eV was employed after ionization. Hereby, ions are additionally accelerated and collisions with air 8 molecules lead to partial fragmentation of the N-glycan backbone, while the peptide stays intact (17, 18). MS data were acquired in a data-dependent manner, dynamically choosing the 12 most abundant precursor ions from the survey scans (scan range m/z 600\u20131400, resolution 70,000, AGC target value 3e6, maximum injection time 50 ms) for fragmentation (MS/MS) by higher-energy C- trap dissociation (30% normalized collision energy). Dynamic exclusion was enabled with an exclusion duration of 15 s. The AGC target value for MS/MS was 5e4 at 120 ms maximum injection time at a scan range of 200 to 2000 m/z. The precursor isolation window was 1.5 m/z and the resolution for higher-energy C-trap dissociation spectra was set to 17,500. The \u2018underfill ratio\u2019, specifying the minimum percentage of the target ion value to be reached at the maximum fill time, was 1%. Ions with charge state 5 and above as well as ions with unassigned charge states were excluded from fragmentation. Internal lock mass calibration was switched off.",

The following modifications were used for analyses: carbamidomethylation of cysteine (constant), oxidation of methionine (variable), and HexNac/HexNac2 of asparagine (variable). For N-glycan analysis, MS1 spectra were averaged and N-glycan composition of peptide-attached subtrees were annotated manually. N-acetylhexosamine, hexose, methylated hexose, pentose and deoxyhexose were considered as possible monosaccharides.",

KARs regulate many aspects of plant development and environmental responses, including Seed germination, hypocotyl elongation, leaf shape, root development, and resistance to drought, salt, and heat stress. The transcriptional repressor proteins SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1) and SMAX1-like2 (SMXL2) integrate karrikin signaling by repressing gene expression through direct binding to promoters or through inhibiting activities of transcription factors. To elucidate the mechanism by which SMAX1 and SMXL2 mediate KAR signaling, we performed immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis and identified peptides in transgenic seedlings that overexpress GFP, SMAX1-GFP, and SMXL2-GFP, respectively.",

Peptides were extracted using 5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) and 50% acetonitrile (v/v) with ultrasonication. The desalted peptides were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid (v/v) and analyzed by mass spectroscopy (MS). Precursor ions were measured in the Orbitrap analyzer at 240,000 resolution and with a target value of 106 ions.

Electrophoresis was performed for 3 min at 200 V, which was enough for proteins to enter gel. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 Protein Stain (Cepham Life Sciences, United States) for 20 minutes and washed overnight using mqH2O (4\u00b0C). Next day, bands were excised and chopped in 1 mm3 pieces using bladed slicer and transferred in 96 well perforated plate plates (GlySci, United States). Laminar flow hood was used for sample handling, when possible. Distaining of gel pieces was performed using a series of alternate washing steps with ammonium bicarbonate (Fluka, United States) and acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United Kingdom). Distained gel pieces were washed and dehydrated using acetonitrile, followed by additional drying in vacuum centrifuge (30 min, -120\u00b0C). Protein samples were reduced using 10 mM dithiothreitol (1 h, 56\u00b0C) and alkylated using 55 mM iodoacetamide (45 min, 37\u00b0C, dark) (both Sigma-Aldrich, United States). Samples were washed and dehydrated again using ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. For obtaining peptides from protein samples, gel pieces were incubated with trypsin solution (1.25 ng/\u00b5L, Promega, United States), first for 45 minutes at 4 \u00baC, followed by an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. Peptides were collected and extracted in clean 96 well collection plate using 99.8 % (v/v) acetonitrile plus 0.2 % (v/v) formic acid (30 min, RT) and 50 % (v/v) acetonitrile plus 0.1 % (v/v) formic acid (30 min, RT) (Sigma-Aldrich, United States). Afterwards, samples were dried in vacuum centrifuge (1 h 30 min, -120\u00b0C) and resuspended in a 20 \u00b5L of 5% (v/v) acetonitrile plus 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Before MS analysis peptide samples were desalted with OLIGO R3 beads (Life technologies, United States) placed in 96-well plates with PVDF membranes (Corning, United States). Desalting was performed with 0.1 % formic acid wash steps before peptides being eluted from the beads twice with 30 % acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Samples were subsequently dried and resuspended in a solution of 5 % (v/v) acetonitrile plus 0.1 %  Samples were analysed by LC-MS/MS method using an UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC (RSLC, United States) coupled to a Thermo QExactive HF mass detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) with electrospray ionization. Peptide mixtures were eluted for 60 min using a gradient containing 92 % of solution A (0.1 % formic acid in water) and 8 % up to 33 % of solution B (0.1 % formic acid in acetonitrile). Solvent flow was set to 300 nL per minute.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "To identify proteins, data were searched against the human Swissprot and Trembl database (December 12, 2021) using Mascot (Matrix science, version 2.5.1). Fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.6 Da, while parent ion tolerance was 10 PPM. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine was variable modification. Only tryptic peptides with up to one missed cleavage permitted and with 2+ 3+ and 4+ charged precursor ions were considered in further analysis. Protein identifications were refined using Scaffold (Proteome software, version 5.1.0.). Protein (99.9 %) and peptide (95 %) probabilities were assigned using the Protein Prophet algorithm (Nesvizhskii et al., 2003) as incorporated by Scaffold including a minimum of four unique peptides per each protein. Total spectral counts were used as a measure of protein abundance.",

                "projectDescription": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are crucial for tumor initiation, growth, dissemination, and resistance to therapy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), an enzyme present in endometrial CSCs, using N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ALDH inhibition in endometrial cancer stem cells (CSCs). ECC-1 and RL95-2 cell lines were subjected to proteome profiling with and without N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB).",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "A protein solution containing Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) and Dithiothreitol (DTT) was loaded into filtering columns and extensively washed with 8 M urea in HEPES buffer. After reduction with DTT and alkylation with iodoacetamide (IAA), the proteins were incubated overnight with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting digested peptides were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. As previously described, samples were analysed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics using nano-LC-MSMS equipment (Dionex RSLCnano 3000) coupled to an Exploris 480 Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Briefly, peptide samples were analysed by nano\u2013LC-MS/MS (Dionex RSLCnano 3000) coupled to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The samples (5\u00a0\u00b5L) were loaded onto a custom-made fused capillary precolumn (length, 2 cm; outer diameter, 360 \u00b5m; and inner diameter, 75 \u00b5m) with a flow of 5 \u00b5L/min for 7 minutes. Trapped peptides were separated on a custom-made fused capillary column (length, 20\u00a0cm; outer diameter, 360 \u00b5m, and inner diameter, 75 \u00b5m) packed with ReproSil-PurC18 3\u00a0\u00b5m resin (Dr Maisch, Ammerbuch-Entringen, Germany) with a flow of 300 nL/min using a linear gradient from 92% A (0.1% formic acid) to 28% B (0.1% formic acid in 100% acetonitrile) over 93 minutes followed by a linear gradient from 28 to 35% B over 20 minutes at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Mass spectra were acquired in positive ion mode, applying an automatic data-dependent switch between one Orbitrap survey. MS scan in the mass range of 400 to 1200 mass/charge ratio (m/z) was followed by higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentation and Orbitrap detection of the 15 most intense ions observed in the MS scan. The target value in the Orbitrap for the MS scan was 1,000,000 ions at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200. Fragmentation in the HCD cell was performed at a normalised collision energy of 31 eV. The ion selection threshold was set to 25,000 counts, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms for MS scans and 300 and 500 ms for MS/MS scans.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Mass accuracy was set at 5 ppm on the peptide level and 0.01 Da on the fragment ions. A maximum of four missed cleavages were used. Carbamidomethyl (C) was set as a fixed modification. Methionine oxidation, N-terminal protein acetylation, lysine diglycine tag, lysine acetylation, serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation were set as variable modifications. The MSMS spectra were searched against a standard human proteome database from UniProt (3AUP000005640) with a concatenation of all the sequences in reverse, maintaining only lysine and arginine in place. The data was searched and quantified with VEMS.",

                "projectDescription": "Various organic and natural pesticides play a vital role in insect control, leading to variation in their protein profile (Abubakar et al., 2019; James & Xu, 2012). The sex, size, weight, and growth conditions could be the possible factors associated with fluctuations in the concentration of protein production in the cockroach (Bouchebtiet al., 2022) The current study of Perplanata americana under pesticide activity considered to observe the proteomics of Brain and protein expression under stressed conditions. 15 cockroaches were exposed to 5g of Laxman Rekha (11:1 ratio) to assess the impact of pesticide on protein synthesis.  National and international research conducted on aqueous and alcoholic extraction of gut, exoskeleton and brain protein of Periplaneta spp. and Blatta spp have revealed 10 potential antibacterial proteins between 18 kDa to 72kDa range. These proteins were purified using chromatographic techniques like single dimension reducing PAGE, FPLC-MS, LC-MS, MALDI TOF-MS etc. The current study is aimed at isolation, identification and characterisation of proteins from cockroach brain tissue lysate using Liquid chromatography and Orbitrap Mass spectrometer technique. The data analysis was done using Thermo Proteome Discoverer software version 2.2. 0.388. The database used was Uniprot-Periplaneta americana.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Protein extraction: Around 10 cockroaches were killed using 5g of commercial pesticide i.e. Laxman Rekha. Brain tissue lysate of cockroaches was minced, homogenised, and placed directly into a 2mL microtube containing 160 \ud835\udf07L of freshly prepared 7M urea, 2M thiourea, and 1M ammonium bicarbonate at 95\u00ba C for 20min followed by 60\u00baC for 1.5hrs (Luebker & Koepsell, 2016). \nSample preparation: The protein sample (~50 \u03bcg) was reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l of 7-8 M Urea and incubated at RT for an hour along with 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP).   The solution was then gently vortexed by adding 50 mM of DTT solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in dark. The urea concentration was reduced to <1M by adding 25 mM NH4HCO3. The protein sample was then subjected to trypsin (Pierce) digestion by adding trypsin in a 1:30 ratio (Trypsin: Protein) at 37\u00b0C in a dry bath for 16 hours. After trypsinization, the sample was dried in a speed vac and reconstituted in 20\u00b5l of MilliQ water with 0.1% formic acid and desalting was performed.\nLiquid Chromatography: The sample was isolated using Liquid chromatography. Liquid chromatography was performed using Thermo EASY-nLC 1200, (ThermoFisher Scientific) instrument. The analytical column used was PepMap RSLC C18 2um, 100A x 50 cm and the precolumn used was Acclaim PepMap 100, 100um x 2cm nanoviper with mobile phase as solvent A: 0.1% Formic acid in Milli-Q water, solvent B: 80:20 (ACN: Milli-Q water) + 0.1% Formic acid (Agrawal and Verma, 2020). The sample flow was maintained as 4.0 \u03bcl / min total volume in pre-column equilibrium was 10 \u03bcl and that in analytical equilibrium was 3 \u03bcl. The total flow was maintained at 300 nl/min for around 60 min. The mixture was 5% for beginning, 10% at 5 min, 50% at 50 min, 95% at 55 and 60 min (Bankar et al., 2021). Mass Spectrometry: Q Exactive Plus - Orbitrap Mass Spectrometry (ThermoFisher Scientific) instrument was used to perform analysis of crude protein sample. The sample was run for 60 min with a scan range of 350 m/z to 2000 m/z having a constant flow rate of 3.0 \u03bcl/min, inner instrumental diameter was 2.303 mm (Imbert et al., 2021).",

                "title": "Characterization of the Clostridioides difficile 630\u0394erm putative Pro-Pro endopeptidase CD1597",
                "projectDescription": "Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated infections worldwide. Within the host, C. difficile can transition from a sessile to a motile state by secretion of PPEP-1, which releases the cells from the intestinal epithelium by cleaving adhesion proteins. PPEP-1 belongs to the group of Pro-Pro endopeptidases, which are characterized by their unique ability to cleave proline-proline bonds. Interestingly, another putative member of this group, CD1597, is present in C. difficile. Although it possesses a domain similar to other PPEPs, CD1597 displays several distinct features that suggest a markedly different role for this protein.  We investigated the proteolytic activity of CD1597 by testing various potential substrates. In addition, we investigated the effect of the absence of CD1597 by generating an insertional mutant of the cd1597 gene. Using the cd1597 mutant, we sought to identify phenotypic changes through a series of in vitro experiments and quantitative proteomic analyses. Furthermore, we aimed to study the localization of this protein using a fluorogenic fusion protein.  Despite its similarities to PPEP-1, CD1597 did not show proteolytic activity. In addition, the absence of CD1597 caused an increase in various sporulation proteins during the stationary phase, yet we did not observe any alterations in the sporulation frequency of the cd1597 mutant. Furthermore, a promoter activity assay indicated a very low expression level of cd1597 in vegetative cells that was independent of the culture medium and growth stage. The low expression was corroborated by our comprehensive proteomics analysis of whole cell cultures, which failed to identify CD1597. However, an analysis of purified C. difficile spores identified CD1597 as part of the spore proteome. Hence, we predict that the protein is involved in sporulation, although we were unable to define a precise role for CD1597 in C. difficile",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Cells of C. difficile were pelleted by centrifugation (6000 x g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). Pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of ice-cold PBS and washed twice (6000 x g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). After the last wash, pellets were resuspended in 5 mL urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1x cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail EDTA free). Resuspended cells were incubated for 20 min on ice prior to lysis by sonication, and cells were subsequently lysed by sonication for five bursts of 30 s with cooling on ice in between rounds. After lysis, tubes were centrifuged (15 min, 15000 x g, 4 \u00b0). Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until further use. For each strain, 100 \u03bcg of protein in 100 \u03bcL of ST buffer was used as the starting material. Proteins were reduced using 5 mM TCEP for 30 min, alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min, and quenched with 10 mM DTT for 15 min, all at room temperature. Proteins were precipitated by chloroform-methanol precipitation. For this, 400 \u03bcL methanol, 100 \u03bcL chloroform, and 300 \u03bcL dH2O were added with vortexing in between each step. Following centrifugation (21130 x g, 2 min, RT), the pellet was washed two times with 500 \u03bcL methanol. The protein pellet was subsequently resuspended in 100 \u03bcL of 40 mM HEPES pH 8.4 containing 4 \u03bcg trypsin and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Then, another 4 \u03bcg of trypsin was added and incubated for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C. Spores of C. diffficile were allowed to develop for 7 days and purified using a Gastrografin gradient. Spore pellets were resuspended in 500 \u00b5l dH2O. Spores were washed three times in dH2O before storage at -20 \u00b0C until further use. Spores were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l extraction buffer (4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM DTT, 125 mM Tris-HCL pH 6.8, 10% glycerol) and proteins were extracted by incubation for 10 min in a heat block set to 108 \u00b0C. After centrifugation (15000 x g, 2 min, RT) supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Again, 50 \u00b5l extraction buffer was added to the pellet and this repeated, resulting in a total volume of 100 \u00b5l extracted spore proteins.  The total spore protein material per strain (<100 \u00b5g) was used as the starting material. A chloroform-methanol precipitation was performed and the resulting protein pellet was resuspended in urea lysis buffer. Proteins were reduced, alkylated, and quenched as described above. After chloroform-methanol precipitation, 2 \u00b5g LysC was added and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then, 4 \u00b5g trypsin was added and the tubes were incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C before adding another 4 \u00b5g of trypsin and incubation for 3 h.  TMT labeling was performed on 10 \u03bcg of tryptic peptides using TMTpro 16plex labeling (Thermo Fisher Scientific, lot no. UK292954 for whole cultures, WK334339 for spores) for 1 h at RT. Excess TMT label was quenched with 5% hydroxylamine for 15 min at RT. The labeled peptides from each sample were mixed and freeze-dried. The peptides were resuspended in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.4 and separated in 12 fractions on an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm, 3.5 \u03bcM). Half of the labeled peptides (80 \u03bcg) were injected. Mobile phase A was 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.4). Mobile phase B was 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 80% acetonitrile (pH 8.4). The gradient was as follows: 2% B, 0\u20135 min; 2%\u201390% B, 5\u201335 min; 90% B, 35\u201340 min; 90%\u20132% B, 40\u201341 min; and 2% B, 41\u201365 min. The 12 collection vials were rotated every 30 s during sample collection. The 12 fractions were freeze-dried and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.   LC-MS/MS analyses The fractions were analyzed by online C18 nanoHPLC MS/MS with an Ultimate3000nano gradient HPLC system (Thermo, Bremen, Germany), and an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo). Peptides were injected onto a pre-column (300 \u03bcm \u00d7 5 mm, C18 PepMap, 5 \u03bcm, 100 A), and eluted via a homemade analytical nano-HPLC column (30 cm \u00d7 75 \u03bcm; Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 \u03bcm, 120 A; Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany). The gradient was run with a gradient of 2% to 40% solvent B (20/80/0.1 water/acetonitrile/formic acid (FA) v/v) in 142 min. The nano-HPLC column was drawn to a tip of \u223c10 \u03bcm and acted as the electrospray needle of the MS source. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent MS/MS mode for a cycle time of 3 s, with HCD collision energies at 36V and recording of the MS2 spectrum in the Orbitrap, with a quadrupole isolation width of 1.2 m/z. In the master scan (MS1) the resolution was 120,000, the scan range 400-1500, at standard AGC target at a maximum fill time of 50 ms. A lock mass correction on the background ion m/z = 445.12003 was used. Precursors were dynamically excluded after n = 1 with an exclusion duration of 45 s and with a precursor range of 10 ppm. Charge states 2\u20135 were included. For MS2 the first mass was set to 110 Da, and the MS2 scan resolution was 45,000 at an AGC target of 200% @maximum fill time of 60 ms.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "In the post-analysis process, raw data were converted to peak lists using Proteome Discoverer version 2.4.0.305 (for analysis of whole cell cultures) and 2.5.0.400 (for analysis of spores) (Thermo Electron) and submitted to the UniProt C. difficile 630\u0394erm database (3752 entries) (Taxon ID: 272563) using Mascot v. 2.2.07 (www.matrixscience.com) for peptide identification. Mascot searches were performed with 10 ppm and 0.02 Da deviation for precursor and fragment mass, respectively, and trypsin was selected as enzyme specificity with a maximum of two missed cleavages. The variable modifications included Oxidation (M) and Acetyl (protein N-term). The static modifications included TMTpro (N-term, K) and Carbamidomethyl (C).

                "title": "Inherited mitochondrial dysfunction impacts corneal innervation fibre identity, fonctionnality and regenerative potential",
                "projectDescription": "The cornea is the transparent tissue covering the anterior part of the eye. Its main roles are to convey the light toward the retina, and to act as a protective barrier against infection or injury for the eye. The transparency of the cornea is a crucial component of its functionality and is the result of specific architecture and cell arrangements. The inner layer of the cornea is the endothelium, composed of a monolayer of endothelial cells. The next layer is the stroma, representing about two third of the thickness of the cornea, and is mainly composed of a specifically arranged extracellular matrix, secreted by few keratocytes1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4. Finally, the external layer is a life-long renewed pluristratified epithelium. The regulated epithelial homeostasis, crucial to maintain the corneal transparency, relies on stem and progenitor cells5.  To coordinate epithelial homeostasis and healing, and to adequately respond to any change in the corneal environment, this tissue is highly innervated6,7. The corneal innervation is mainly composed of A and C sensory fibres whose cell bodies are located in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion8. Those fibres penetrate the corneal stroma from the periphery, as bundles of fibres branching and spreading within the stroma9. When entering in the epithelium, the fibres branche again and radiate horizontally to form the subbasal plexus. Finally, the sensory fibres shift orientation to reach the top of the epithelium, where they end up as free nerve endings6,7. There are three classes of fibres innervating the cornea: the mechano-nociceptors, the cold sensing neurons and the polymodal nociceptors, reacting respectively to mechanical, thermal and chemical stimuli10,11. Stimuli transduction is not the only role of the corneal innervation, as these fibres have a crucial role on epithelial homeostasis through the secretion of trophic factors essential for epithelial cell survival12.   Due to its localization, the cornea is highly exposed to ultraviolet radiation and high oxygen tension, making it particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial defects13. These defects can be either inherited or non-inherited. Inherited forms result from mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear gene defects affecting mitochondrial function14. Inherited mitochondrial dysfunction is a key factor in the progression of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and keratoconus13,15,16. Non-inherited mitochondrial dysfunction, on the other hand, can occur due to spontaneous mtDNA mutations or somatic mutations that accumulate with age, rendering the mitochondrial metabolism less efficient with time17. To date, the impact of inherited mitochondrial dysfunctions on corneal epithelium physiology has not been extensively studied. Case reports have linked mitochondrial diseases to corneal cloudiness18,19, perforation20 and edema21. Furthermore, mitochondrial defect was associated to inflammatory context and ROS production in ocular surface pathologies13,22. Despite these studies, the direct effect of mitochondrial disfunction on corneal biology remains elusive. Among the known pathologies originating from an inherited mitochondrial dysfunction, the dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is an inherited blinding disease caused by the degenescence of the retinal cell ganglions forming the optic nerve23. The mutation of the gene OPA1 is responsible for the majority of the DOA diagnostics. OPA1 gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein involved in the fusion process and is essential to maintain the organelle integrity. Generally, optic neuropathy is the characteristic syndrome for DOA, but a subset of patients, called dominant optic atrophy plus (DOA+), also declare extra-ocular syndromes such as ataxia, deafness and peripheral neuropathies24,25. A mouse model, bearing the OPA1delTTAG mutation, recapitulates the degenerative syndromes encountered in DOA+ patients25.. While DOA is associated with lens cloudiness, no report has linked DOA to ocular surface defects. Here, we investigated the impact of OPA1 delTTAG mutation on mouse cornea as its structure includes a large amout of sensory fibres that are crucial to maintain corneal homeostasis.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Tear samples were collected successively from both eyes for 1 minute each using 1\u00b5L microcapillary glass tubes (Merck, Drummond Scientific, reference P1424-1PAK). The samples from both eyes were pooled in the same tube for each mice, in a total volume of 35\u00b5L of ABC (Ammonium Bicarbonate) buffer. The samples were kept at 4\u00b0C on ice during the sampling process at the animal facility, and then stored at -80\u00b0C for long term storage. Tear samples were thawed at 4\u00b0C on ice and the total protein concentration was measured with a NanoDrop One Microvolume UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, reference ND-ONE-W) by using 2\u00b5L of sample. After the protein concentration measurement, the samples were digested directly in-solution. The reduction step was performed by adding a 200mM Dithiothreitol (DTT), 100mM TricHCl (pH 8.5) solution to the samples (DTT final concentration: 20mM). Samples were incubated for 1h at 56\u00c2\u00b0C, 350rpm, protected from light. Then, the alkylation step was done by adding a 300mM 2-Iodoacetamide (IAA), 100mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5) solution to the samples (IAA final concentration: 40mM). Samples were incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C, 350rpm, protected from light. The digestion was achieved by adding 1\u00b5g of Trypsin Gold from a 1\u00b5g/\u00b5L solution, 60\u00b5L of 100mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5) and a 200mM DTT, 100mM Tris HCl (pH 8.5) solution (DTT final concentration: 10mM). Samples were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C, 450rpm, protected from light. On the next day, the digestion was stopped by adding formic acid (FA, final concentration: 2%). The samples were then desalted with C18 tips with the AssayMAP Bravo Protein Sample Prep Platform (Agilent Technologies), by using the Peptide Clean-Up program. The loaded volume was set to 108\u00b5L and the elution volume was set to 30\u00b5L. After the clean-up, the eluted samples were dried at 50\u00b0C with an acid-resistant CentriVap centrifugal vacuum concentrator (Labconco) connected to a Centrivap -50\u00b0C cold trap (Labconco) and a RZ6 rotary vane pump (Vacuubrand, reference 20698130). The dried samples were temporarily stored at -20\u00b0C. The samples were resuspended in 10\u00b5L phase A of Q-TOF (2% ACN, 0.1% FA in water HPLC grade) in mass spectrometry polypropylene vials (Agilent technologies, reference 5190-3155). The samples (1\u00b5L out of 10\u00b5L) were analyzed online by using the NanoElute\u00ae High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (Bruker) coupled with the Impact II Quadrupole Time-Of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. The peptides were separated on a C18 column (FORTY, reference 1842619 from Bruker; 75\u00b5m x 400mm; Acclaim Pepmap RSLC, C18, 1.9\u00b5m, 120\u00c3\u2026) following a gradient of 2-15% phase B in 55 minutes, 15-25% in 25 minutes, 25-35% in 10 minutes and 35-95% in 10 minutes (phase A = 2% ACN, 0.1% FA in water HPLC grade; phase B = 0.1 % FA in 90% ACN). The column was kept at 50\u00c2\u00b0C and the flow rate was set to 300 nL/min. Water, acetonitrile (ACN), formic acid (FA) were all HPLC grade and purchased from Biosolve (Dieuze, France).",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Protein identification was performed using MaxQuant software (1.6.17.0 version). The parameters were as follows: the enzyme used for protein cleavage was the trypsin, the mass tolerance was set to 10ppm for the precursor ions and to 0.005 Da for the MS/MS. The murine proteome from the Uniprot database was used (April 2022 version). The carbamidomethylation of the cysteine was programmed as a fixed modification, the oxidation of the methionine and the deamidation of the asparagine and glutamine were programmed as variable modifications. The maximum number of modifications for one peptide was set to 5. Data processing was performed using Perseus software (1.6.15.0 version). Proteins considered as contaminants and redundant proteins were deleted. Data were grouped following the age (3.5 months or 6 months) and the genotype (Opa1+/- or Opa1+/+). The values obtained for each protein were transformed by using the log2(x) formula. For each time point, the proteins must be found in the 3 biological replicates of each genotype in order to be conserved. Data were then normalized in order to follow a normal distribution.  Correlations between the protein composition and the parameters (age or genotype) were analyzed following a distance calculated with the Pearson correlation coefficient. Differences in the protein composition among groups were tested using the Student t-test, with a permutated-based FDR of 0.05 (p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant).",

                "projectDescription": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is currently recognized as the primary carcinogenic pathogen associated with gastric tumorigenesis, and its high prevalence and resistance make it difficult to tackle. A graph neural network-based deep learning model, employing different training sets of 13,638 molecules for pre-training and fine-tuning through rigorous iterative learning processes, was aided in predicting and exploring novel molecules against H. pylori. A positively predicted novel berberine (BBR) derivative 8 with 3,13-disubstituted alkene exhibited a potency against all tested drug-susceptible and resistant H. pylori strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.25\u20130.5 \u03bcg/mL. Strikingly, pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated an ideal gastric retention of 8, with the stomach concentration significantly higher than its MIC value at 24 h post dose. Oral administration of 8 and proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (OPZ) showed a 2.2-log reduction in the gastric bacterial burden compared with the control group, which is comparable to the triple-therapy, namely OPZ + amoxicillin (AMX) + clarithromycin (CLA), and partially restored the diversity of the intestinal flora as well as the abundance of probiotics. A combination of OPZ + AMX + CLA + 8 could further decrease the bacteria load (2.8-log reduction). More importantly, the mono-therapy of 8 showed comparable eradicative efficacies compared with both triple-therapy (OPZ + AMX + CLA) and the quadruple-therapy (OPZ + AMX + CLA + bismuth citrate) groups. SecA and BamD, playing a major role in outer membrane protein (OMP) transport and assembling, were identified and verified as the direct targets of 8 by employing the chemoproteomics technique. The treatment of 8 induced the death of H. pylori caused by OMP deficiency, and the subsequent reduced adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. In summary, by targeting the relatively conserved OMPs transport and assembling system, 8 has the potential to be developed as a novel anti-H. pylori candidate, especially for the eradication of drug-resistant strains. The deep learning model established in this study might provide a reliable prediction tool for future anti-H. pylori candidate discovery.",

                "title": "Conserved signalling functions for Mps1, Mad1 and Mad2 in the Cryptococcus neoformans spindle checkpoint",
                "projectDescription": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic, human fungal pathogen which undergoes fascinating switches in cell cycle control and ploidy when it encounters stressful environments such as the human lung. Here we carry out a mechanistic analysis of the spindle checkpoint which regulates the metaphase to anaphase transition, focusing on Mps1 kinase and the downstream checkpoint components Mad1 and Mad2.  We demonstrate that Cryptococcus mad1D or mad2D strains are unable to respond to microtubule perturbations, continuing to re-bud and divide, and die as a consequence.  Fluorescent tagging of Chromosome 3, using a lacO array and mNeonGreen-lacI fusion protein, demonstrates that mad mutants are unable to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in the absence of microtubule polymers. Thus, the classic checkpoint functions of the SAC are conserved in Cryptococcus.  In interphase, GFP-Mad1 is enriched at the nuclear periphery, and it is recruited to unattached kinetochores in mitosis.  Purification of GFP-Mad1 followed by mass spectrometric analysis of associated proteins show that it forms a complex with Mad2 and that it interacts with other checkpoint signalling components (Bub1) and effectors (Cdc20 and APC/C sub-units) in mitosis.  We also demonstrate that overexpression of Mps1 kinase is sufficient to arrest Cryptococcus cells in mitosis, and show that this arrest is dependent on both Mad1 and Mad2.  We find that a C-terminal fragment of Mad1 is an effective in vitro substrate for Mps1 kinase and map several Mad1 phosphorylation sites.  Some sites are highly conserved within the C-terminal Mad1 structure and we demonstrate that mutation of threonine 667 (T667A) leads to loss of checkpoint signalling and abrogation of the GAL-MPS1 arrest.  Thus Mps1-dependent phosphorylation of C-terminal Mad1 residues is a critical step in Cryptococcus spindle checkpoint signalling.  We conclude that CnMps1 protein kinase, Mad1 and Mad2 proteins have all conserved their important, spindle checkpoint signalling roles helping ensure high fidelity chromosome segregation.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Protein samples from all biological replicates were processed at the same time and using the same digestion protocol without any deviations. They were subjected for MS analysis under the same conditions, and protein and peptide lists were generated using the same software and the same parameters. Specifically, proteins were separated on gel (NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis-Tris gel, Life Technologies, UK), in NuPAGE buffer (MES) and visualised using InstantBlueTM stain (AbCam, UK). The stained gel bands were excised and de-stained with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and 100% (v/v) acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and proteins were digested with trypsin. In brief, proteins were reduced in 10mM dithiothreitol (Sigma Aldrich, UK) for 30mins at 37\u00c5\u00e3C and alkylated in 55mM iodoacetamide (Sigma Aldrich, UK) for 20 min at ambient temperature in the dark. They were then digested overnight at 37 degrees with 12.5 ng trypsin per \u03bcL (Pierce, UK). Following digestion, samples were diluted with an equal volume of 0.1% TFA and spun onto StageTips as described previously. Peptides were eluted in 40 \u03bcL of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA and concentrated down to 1 \u03bcL by vacuum centrifugation (Concentrator 5301, Eppendorf, UK). The peptide sample was then prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis by diluting it to 5 \u03bcL with 0.1% TFA. LC-MS analyses were performed on an Orbitrap Exploris480\u2122 Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) coupled on-line, to an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK). Peptides were separated on a 50 cm (2 \u03bcm particle size) EASY-Spray column (Thermo Scientific, UK), which was assembled on an EASYSpray source (Thermo Scientific, UK) and operated constantly at 50oC. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade water and mobile phase B consisted of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were loaded onto the column at a flow rate of 0.3 \u03bcL min-1 and eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 \u03bcL min-1 according to the following gradient: 2 to 40% mobile phase B in 150 min and then to 95% in 11 min. Mobile phase B was retained at 95% for 5 min and returned to 2% a minute after until the end of the run (190 min). Survey scans were recorded at 120,000 resolution (scan range 350-1500 m/z) with an ion target of 4.0e5, and injection time of 50ms. MS2 was performed in the orbitrap at 15,000 resolution, with ion target of 2.0E4 and HCD fragmentation (Olsen et al, 2007) with normalized collision energy of 28. The isolation window in the quadrupole was 1.4 Thomson. Only ions with charge between 2 and 6 were selected for MS2. Dynamic exclusion was set at 60 s.",

Digestion mode was set to specific with trypsin allowing maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Label-free quantitation analysis was performed by employing the MaxLFQ algorithm. Peptide and protein identifications were filtered to 1% FDR. Statistical analysis was performed by Perseus software, version 1.6.2.1.",

                "title": "Fatty Acid Synthase as Interacting Anticancer Target of the Terpenoid Myrianthic Acid disclosed by MS-Based Proteomics Approaches",
                "projectDescription": "This research focuses on the target deconvolution of the natural compound myrianthic acid, a triterpenoid characterized by an ursane skeleton isolated from the roots of Myrianthus arboreus and from Oenothera maritima Nutt. (Onagraceae), using MS-based chemical proteomic techniques. Application of Drug Affinity Responsive Target Stability (DARTS) and targeted-Limited Proteolysis coupled to Mass Spectrometry (t-LiP-MS) led to the identification of the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) as an interesting macromolecular counterpart of myrianthic acid. This result, confirmed by comparison with the natural triteprenoid ursolic acid, was thoroughly investigated and validated in silico by molecular docking, which gave a precise picture of the interactions in the MA/FAS complex. Moreover, in vitro biological assays showcased the inhibitory activity of myrianthic acid against the FAS enzyme, most likely related to its antiproliferative activity towards tumor cells. Given the sig-nificance of FAS in specific pathologies, especially cancer, the myrianthic acid structural moieties could serve as a promising reference point to start a potential development of innovative ap-proaches in therapy.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Lysate was split into four aliquots of equal volume (100 \u03bcL each). Three of these were incubated with different concentrations of myrianthic acid (1\u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM, 100\u03bcM) dis-solved in DMSO; the fourth was incubated with DMSO as a control. After 1 h of incu-bation at room temperature under continuous shaking (Mini-Rotator, Biosan), samples were split again and treated with different concentrations of subtilisin (enzyme to proteins ratio of 1:2500, 1:1500 and 1:500 w/w) for 30 min at 25\u00b0C under continuous shaking (500 rpm, Thermomixer, Biosan). Moreover, proteolysis was simulated on the control sample by adding an equal volume of water. The protease was quenched by adding PMSF 1 mM final concentration (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, Sig-ma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) to each sample and shacked for 10 min, 25\u00b0C 500 rpm. This experiment was carried out in triplicate. For the electrophoretic separation, 7 \u03bcL of each sample were added to SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60 mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.001% bromophenol blue, 10% glyc-erol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. These mixtures were loaded on a 4%\u201312% Bis-Tris CriterionTM XT Precast Gel (BioRad Laboratories), and the elec-trophoresis was performed in BioRad equipment (BioRad Laboratories). The gel was then fixed for 15 minutes (fixing solution: 50% H2O, 40% MeOH, 10% AcOH), washed three times (10 minutes each) with H2O and then submitted to Coomassie staining (BioRad Laboratories) for 1 hour at room temperature under continuous shaking. The excess dye was removed by extensively washing the gel with H2O and a scan image of the resulting gel was then obtained through LabScan. Bands whose intensity was cor-related to myrianthic acid concentration were submitted to in situ digestion protocol with trypsin [45]. Band pieces were washed by shrinking/swelling cycles using CH3CN and ammonium bicarbonate (AmBic, 50 mM, pH 8.5), alternatively. Then, disulphide bonds were reduced by treating the gel pieces with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT, 6.5 mM in 50 mM AmBic, 60 minutes, 60\u00b0C) and the formed thiols were carboxyamidomethylated with iodoacetamide (IAA, 54 mM in 50 mM AmBic, 30 minutes, room temperature, in the dark). Residual reagents were removed by shrinking/swelling cycles, and gel pieces rehydrated in a 12 ng/\u00b5L trypsin/LysC solution (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) on ice for 1 h. The excess enzymes were then removed, and 50 \u00b5L of 50 mM AmBic were added to allow protein digestion to proceed overnight at 37\u00b0C (Thermomixer, Eppen-dorf). The supernatant was then collected, and peptides were extracted from the gel slices, shrinking them twice with 100% CH3CN. All the supernatants were collected and combined to be then dried out under vacuum (SpeedVac Concentrator Plus, Ep-pendorf) and solubilized in 30 \u00b5L of 10% Formic Acid (FA) for the subsequent nano-flow RP-UPLC MS/MS analysis. 1 \u00b5L of each sample was submitted to nano-flow RP-UPLC MS/MS analysis performed on the Orbitrap Q-Exactive Classic Mass Spec-trometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen) coupled to an UltiMate 3000 Ultra-High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen), equipped with an EASY-Spray PepMAPTM RSLC C18 column (3 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, 75 \u03bcm \u00d7 50 cm, ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen). Gradient ranged from 1 min at 3% B up to 95% of B in 60 min (A: 95% H2O, 5% CH3CN, 0.1% Acetic Acid (AA); B: 95% CH3CN, 5% H2O, 0.1% AA. ESI source parameters were set as follows: capillary temperature 250 \u00b0C; sheath and auxiliary gas flow (N2) 0 (arbitrary units); AGC target 3e6; Maxi-mum IT 50ms. MS spectra were acquired by full range acquisition covering m/z 375\u20131500 with a resolving power of 70 000. To obtain their HRMS/MS product ions, a da-ta-dependent scan experiment was performed with the following parameters: Loop count 8; Resolution 17500; AGC target 1e5; Maximum IT 80 ms; normalization colli-sion energy at 26%, isolation width at 1.6.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Obtained raw files were uploaded into Proteome Discoverer (Proteome Discoverer 2.4TM Software, ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen) which used in silico SwissProt and Sequest HT with multi-peptide search and percolator validation data for the protein\u2019s identification (parameters setting: maximum of two missed cleavages, trypsin diges-tion, fixed modification: carbamidomethyl (C); variable modifications: oxidization (M) and protein N-terminal acetylation. A semi-quantitative analysis was also carried-out, which led to the protein abun-dance in each sample treated with MA compared to the relative control. Data analysis was conducted as follow: proteins with abundance ratio \u201clysate/ctrl\u201d <2 were excluded (\u201clysate\u201d = sample with no MA and no subtilisin, \u201cctrl\u201d = sample with no MA and with subtilisin). The resulting list was filtered, considering as protected only the proteins with increasing abundances according to MA concentrations.",

The UPLC mobile phase A was water containing 0.1% FA, and phase B 80% (vol/vol) methanol/water containing 0.1% FA. The UPLC gradient started with 2% B and increased to 7% at 7 min, then to 20% at 69 min, 35% at 90 min and sharply to 95% within 5 min, remained for 4 min, and finally decreased to 2% within 8 min and re-mained for 3 min. Aliquot (1 \u03bcL) of each HPLC fraction described above was injected to UPLC, and the elution from the analytical column was directly infused to the mass spectrometer for MS/MS analysis.  The voltage of electrospray ionization (ESI) was set as 2200 V, the ion transfer tube temperature was 320 \uf0b0C. For primary mass spectrometry analysis, Orbitrap de-tector was operated with a mass resolution of 120,000 and a scanning range from 350 to 1800 m/z. The Orbitrap was also used as the detector of MS/MS with a mass resolu-tion of 15000, and of MS3 with a resolution of 50000 and a scanning range of 100\u2013200 m/z. The HCD fragmentation cell ran with a collision energy of 23% for the second mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis, and with a collision energy of 60% for the third mass spectrometry (MS3) analysis. Raw MS/MS data were searched in Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, ver-sion 2.4) database for peptide and protein identification. Sequest HT search engine was used for peptide-spectrum matching (PSM). The dynamic modifications were oxida-tion at methionine, methylation at lysine, glutamine and arginine, acetylation at lysine and serine, phosphorylation at serine, threonine and tyrosine, and TMT labeling at ly-sine. The static modifications were carbamidomethylation at cysteine and TMT label-ing at N-terminus of peptides. The quantitative results were normalized based on the total peptide amount in each group.

                "projectDescription": "Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a co-receptor for various cytokines, including TGF-\u03b2, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for fibrosis. However, its role and mechanism in renal fibrosis remains elusive. Here, we show that NRP1 is upregulated in distal tubular (DT) cells of patients with transplant renal insufficiency and mice with renal ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Knockout of Nrp1 reduced multiple endpoints of renal injury and fibrosis. We found that Nrp1 facilitates the binding of TNF-\u03b1 to its receptor in DT cells after renal injury. This signaling results in a downregulation of lysine crotonylation of the metabolic enzyme Cox4i1, decreased cellular energetics and exacerbation of renal injury. Furthermore, by single-cell RNA-sequencing we found that Nrp1-positive DT cells secrete collagen and communicate with myofibroblasts, exacerbating acute kidney injury (AKI)-induced renal fibrosis by activating Smad3. Dual genetic deletion of Nrp1 and Tgfbr1 in DT cells better improves renal injury and fibrosis than either single knockout. Together, these results reveal that targeting of NRP1 represents a promising strategy for the treatment of AKI and subsequent  chronic kidney disease.",

At cell confluency of 70%, the cells were incubated in complete DMEM medium containing QMP-SO-C5-alkyne (30 \u00b5M) and menadione (100 \u00b5M) for 4 h. Menadione was replaced with DMSO in the control sample. The cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed by sonication in PBS on ice. The protein concentrations were measured by BCA. A master-mix solution for the CuAAC reaction was prepared with CuSO4, THPTA, DTB-PEG-azide and sodium ascorbate at the final concentrations of 1 mM, 3 mM, 100 \u00b5M and 5 mM, respectively. 360 \u00b5L of the CuAAC master mix solution was added to 2.5 mL of cell lysates (2 mg/mL) for DTB-PEG-azide conjugation through the CuAAC reaction. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, proteins were precipitated with pre-chilled acetone (18 mL) at -20 \u00b0C overnight. The samples were centrifuged at 5,000g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellet was washed twice with methanol and resuspended in 1.2% SDS in PBS (w/v) with heating at 80 \u00b0C for 5 min.

The samples and beads were incubated at 4 \u00b0C with rotation overnight. The beads were then washed with PBS and water and re-dispersed in 6M urea in PBS. The samples were reduced by TCEP (1 mM) at 65 \u00b0C for 20 min, followed by alkylation with iodoacetamide (18 mM) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min in dark. The beads were centrifuged at 1,400g for 2 min, washed with PBS and re-suspended in 2M urea in PBS. The proteins on the beads were then digested by sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 37 \u00b0C overnight. After tryptic digestion, the beads were centrifuged at 1,400g for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected. The beads were washed twice with 100 \u00b5L PBS, centrifuged, and supernatant collected. The combined fractions gave a total volume of 400 \u00b5L tryptic digested peptides. Samples were dried under a vacuum concentrator and redissolved in 70 \u00b5L TEAB (50 mM). TMT-6plex reagents were prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 30 \u00b5L acetonitrile and 1.5 \u00b5L of the TMT reagent in acetonitrile were added to each sample and the solution mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Then, samples were added 0.6 \u00b5L of 5% hydroxylamine and incubated for 15 min. The resulting samples were mixed at equal volumes, desalted using C18 StageTips, and sent for LC-MS/MS analysis on commercial C18 column (75 \u03bcm i.d. \u00d7 50cm length  \u00d7 2\u03bcm particle size) coupled to the Orbitrap Fusion Tribid Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher).  Chromatographic separation was carried out using buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and bu\ufb00er B (80% MeCN and 0.1% formic acid) with the flow rate of 300 nL/min. Bu\ufb00er B was increase to 27.5% with a linear gradient in 164 min, followed by a further increase to 44% over 52 min. Then, there were a quick ramp of buffer B to 95% in 2 min, an isocratic gradient of 95% buffer B over 7 min and a quick decrease to 3%, where it was held and the column was re-equilibrated. The Orbitrap Fusion was operated in a data-dependent mode for both MS2 and MS3. MS1 scan was acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer with resolution 120,000 at m/z 400. Top speed instrument method was used for MS2 and MS3. For MS2, the isolation width was set at 0.5 Da and isolated precursors were fragmented by CID at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 35% and analyzed in the ion trap using \u201cturbo\u201d scan. Following the acquisition of each MS2 spectrum, a synchronous precursor selection (SPS) MS3 scan was collected on the top 10 most intense ions in the MS2 spectrum. SPS-MS3 precursors were fragmented by higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) at an NCE of 60% and analyzed using the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50,000.",

KO2 was replaced with an equal volume of DMSO in the control sample. After incubation, proteins were precipitated with pre-chilled acetone (600 \u00b5L) at -20 \u00b0C overnight. The samples were centrifuged at maximum speed at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The protein pellets were washed with pre-chilled 0.01M HCl/90% acetone, then resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of 8M urea in PBS. Protein concentration was measured with BCA and normalised to 1.67mg/mL. 15 \u00b5L of the diluted samples was aliquoted out, allowing 25 \u00b5g of the proteins for further MS preparation. 20 \u00b5L of 1\u00d7 ProteaseMax was added to the samples with vigorous vortex for 15 s. Then, 58.5 \u00b5L of ammonium bicarbonate (0.1 M) was added. The samples were then added with 10 \u00b5L of TCEP (110 mM) and incubated at 60 oC for 30 min. Next, 10 \u00b5L of iodoacetamide (150 mM) was added and the solution mixture was incubated at 37 oC for 30 min. After that, the samples were mixed with 1.2 \u00b5L of 5\u00d7 ProteaseMax and vortexed. Sequencing-grade trypsin (20 \u00b5g; Promega) was reconstituted in 40 \u00b5L trypsin buffer and 1.5 \u00b5L of the trypsin solution was added to each sample. Samples were incubated at 37 oC overnight. Samples were then acidified with a final concentration of 5% formic acid and centrifuged at 13200g for 30 min.

                "projectDescription": "Targeted therapies against mutant BRAF are effectively used in combination with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) to treat advanced melanoma. However, treatment success is affected by resistance and adverse events (AEs). Approved BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) show high levels of target promiscuity, which can contribute to these effects. Blood vessels are in direct contact with high plasma concentrations of BRAFi, but effects of the inhibitors in this cell type are unknown. Hence, we aimed to characterize responses to clinically relevant BRAF kinase inhibitors in the vascular endothelium. A mass spectrometry-based analysis of the phosphoproteome of dermal microvascular endothelial cells revealed distinct sets of off-targets of the used BRAFi. Meanwhile, there were only negligible changes to the proteome after 1 h of treatment. Together with our published functional data, these findings provide insights on the surprisingly distinct side effects of BRAFi on endothelial signaling and functionality.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "DMEC from three donors (i1, i26, i29) were treated with Vemurafenib (10 or 100 \u00b5M), Dabrafenib, Encorafenib, or PLX8394 (all 10 \u00b5M), or vehicle control for 1 h. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed on ice with 1% SDS and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Lysates were homogenized by sonication. Lysates were incubated with Dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and alkylated with 20 mM iodoacetamide for another 30 min. Proteins were purified by precipitation with ethanol-acetone, and protein pellets were resolubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC) in 50 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer, pH 8. For each sample, 150 \u00b5g proteins were brought to final volume of 95 \u00b5l (in SDC-TEAB buffer) and digested, firstly with Lysyl-endopeptidase (0.01 AU, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemicals Corp., Osaka, Japan) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and subsequently with trypsin (7.5 \u00b5g per sample) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Peptides in each sample were labeled with one of the tags of TMTpro 18-plex labeling kit (A52045, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All 18 samples were then pooled in equal amounts. Pooled samples were acidified (pH < 2) with formic acid to precipitate SDC and the collected supernatant was lyophilized. Phosphopeptides were isolated using TiO2 affinity chromatography. Briefly, dried peptides were dissolved in TiO2 loading buffer (80% acetonitrile (ACN), 5% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 1 M glycolic acid, all from Sigma) and incubated with 0.6 mg TiO2 beads (Titansphere, GL Sciences, Torrance, CA, USA) per 100 \u00b5g peptide solution for 30\u202fmin at RT on a shaker. The beads were spun down and supernatant was transferred to a new tube with 0.3 mg beads per 100 \u00b5g peptide. After 15 min shaking at RT, beads were spun down again, and supernatant was collected in a separate tube. TiO2 beads from both incubations were subsequently washed with 80% ACN/1% TFA and 10% ACN/0.1% TFA. The unbound peptides in the supernatants from incubation and wash steps were combined and stored as \u201cunmodified peptides\u201d (further details in supplementary methods).  The TiO2 beads with bound phosphopeptides were resuspended in 100 \u00b5l of 100 mM TEAB, pH 8.5 and incubated with PNGase F (1,000 U, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and Sialidase A (5 mU, Prozyme/Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) overnight at 37\u00b0C. The phosphorylated peptides were eluted from the TiO2 beads by incubation with 1.5% ammonium hydroxide solution, pH\u202f11.3, for 10 min at RT with vigorous shaking. The beads were spun down and the supernatant was passed through a C8 membrane (3\u202fM Empore\u2122, Sigma-Aldrich), to remove any residual beads. The membrane was then washed with 100 \u00b5l of 50% ACN to obtain any retained peptide, before the samples were dried. To reduce sample complexity, high-pH reversed-phase fractionation was applied (Boll et al, 2020). Phosphopeptides were dissolved in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 9.3, and loaded on an Acquity UPLC\u00ae-Class CSHTM C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Fractionation was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and a total number of 20 concatenated fractions was collected. The analysis was performed on an Easy-nLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using buffer A (0.1% formic acid, FA) and buffer B (95% ACN, 0.1% FA) and an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All fractions were redissolved in buffer A (0.1% FA) and loaded into the in-house made fused silica capillary column setup (18 cm pulled emitter analytical column with 75 \u03bcm inner diameter, packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 3 \u03bcm (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany)). The peptides were eluted with gradient elution from 2% to 95% buffer B, with a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Ionization was performed by nano-electrospray. Phosphopeptides were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition in positive ion mode mass spectrometry. The m/z scan range for full MS scan was 350 \u2013 1500 Da, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 full width half maximum (FWHM), a normalized Automatic gain control (AGC) target value of 250%, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. From each full scan, the top 10 most intense precursor ions were selected for higher energy collision dissociation (HCD) fragmentation with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 35%. The MS2 was performed with the following parameters: orbitrap resolution of 45,000 FWHM, normalized AGC target value of 300%, isolation window of 1.2 m/z, dynamic exclusion window of 3 s and a maximum injection time in automatic mode.",

This allows translation of efficacy and safety findings from a healthy to a diseased state and provides a means to predict clinical outcome sooner during drug discovery. Calcium handling disturbances including reduced expression levels of the type 2 ryanodine receptor (RYR2) are linked to cardiac dysfunction; here we have created a RYR2 deficient human cardiomyocyte model that mimics some aspects of heart failure. RYR2 deficient cardiomyocytes show differential pharmacological responses to L-type channel calcium inhibitors. Phenotypic and proteomic characterization reveal novel molecular insights with altered expression of structural proteins including CSRP3, SLMAP, and metabolic changes including upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and increased sensitivity to redox alterations. This genetically engineered in vitro cardiovascular model of RYR2 deficiency supports the study of pharmacological responses in the context of calcium handling and metabolic dysfunction enabling translation of drug responses from healthy to perturbed cellular states.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Cardiomyocytes that had been differentiated for 30 days were harvested from 6 well plates. Seven cell pellet aliquots (3x RYR2 Het KO 2 and 4x WT control) of ca. 2 x10 6 cardiomyocytes each were lysed and proteome-extracted in 0.5 % SDS, 0.1 M Tris*HCl pH 8.5, 0.1 M DTT at 90\u00b0C for 5 min followed by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 30 min.

Peptides were eluted using the following gradient of water with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (solvent B): 0-142.5 min 2-45% B, 142.5- 147.5 min 45-50% B, 147.5-154 min 50-90% B, 154-159 min 90% B, 159-160 min 90-2% B, 160- 185 min 2% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode using the Top-speed setting with 2 s cycle time. The MS1-scan resolution in the Orbitrap was set to 120k over 375 to 1,500 m/z, with maximum injection time set to \u201cAutomatic\u201d and a normalized automatic gain control (AGC) target to 250%. Precursor ions passing a 5e3 intensity cut-off and fulfilling monoisotopic precursors filter with z = 2-6+ were selected for fragmentation by higher-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with 30% normalized collision energy (NCE) followed by detection in the Ion trap operated in rapid scan mode at a maximum injection time setting of \u201cdynamic\u201d and the normalized AGC target set to 200%. Dynamic exclusion was enabled upon a single observation for a precursor +/- 5 ppm including isotopes for 40 seconds. LC-MS data were processed using MaxQuant 1.6.10.43 with default settings (protein FDR 0.01, min. peptide length 7, revert decoy mode and razor peptides used for quantification) against the human Uniprot UP000005640 database (reviewed proteins only).",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Label Free Quantification (LFQ) values from the proteinGroups.txt file from MaxQuant were used for differential protein expression analysis. Potential contaminants, reverse hits and proteins only identified by site were removed. Furthermore, only proteins quantified using more than one peptide were used for downstream analytics. The LFQ values were log2-normalised and centered by subtracting the sample median values. Missing values were imputed only for control samples (due to there being enough samples to perform this operation). The approach to imputation was as follows: for proteins missing at most in one control sample, a mean of the three remaining samples was used for imputation. If a value was missing in more than one sample, no imputation was performed. This control-imputed data matrix, containing 4907 protein groups, was used for downstream analysis. One heterozygote sample was removed from differential protein expression analysis due to being a suspected outlier using Pearson correlation analysis and PCA. Limma 3.54.2 R package was used for performing differential expression analysis (2x heterozygote samples vs. 4x controls), using the eBayes procedure with trend parameter set to \u201cTrue\u201d. Overrepresentation analysis was carried out using KEGG pathways and Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and the complete list of analyzed proteins as the background set. Network analysis of the pentose phosphate pathway was performed using IPA.",

After washing in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, cells were pelleted, suspended in previously mentioned buffer, and sonicated. 100 \u00b5g of cell extract was mixed with 8 M Urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and loaded on filter columns (Microcon-30 kDa Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-30 membrane; Merck-Millipore). Columns were washed with 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, reduced using 10 mM DTT in 8 M Urea, and alkylated using 27 mM iodoacetamide in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Afterwards columns were mixed at 600 rpm in a thermomixer for 1 min and incubated without mixing for a further 5 min. 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 was added to each column and centrifuged. After this step, 14 h digestion with trypsin was performed. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10% TFA. Peptides were purified on C18 SepPack columns (Teknokroma) and eluted with 800 \u00b5L 60% ACN, 0.1% TFA, dried in a speed-vacuum concentrator. Dried peptides were resuspended in MS loading buffer (3% ACN, 0.1 % FA) and measured with Q Exactive HF (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hennigsdorf, Germany) coupled to an reverse-phase nano liquid chromatography ACQUITY UPLC M-Class system (Waters). The gradient ramped from 3.2% to 76% CAN. Gradient started from 3.2% ACN and increased to 7.2% ACN in next 20 min, then to 24.8% ACN over 70 min and to 35.2% ACN over next 30 min, followed by a 5 min washout with 76% ACN. The MS was run using a data dependent top-N method that fragmented the top 12 most intense ions per full scan. Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 with an AGC target 3e6, maximum injection time 50 ms, scan range 300 to 1600 m/z. Each dd-MS2 scan was recorded in profile mode at a resolution of 15,000 with an AGC target of 1e5, maximum injection time 100 ms, isolation window 1.2 m/z, normalized collision energy 27 and the dynamic exclusion lasted for 30 sec.",

However, treatment success is affected by resistance and adverse events (AEs). Approved BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) show high levels of target promiscuity, which can contribute to these effects. Blood vessels are in direct contact with high plasma concentrations of BRAFi, but effects of the inhibitors in this cell type are unknown. Hence, we aimed to characterize responses to clinically relevant BRAF kinase inhibitors in the vascular endothelium. A mass spectrometry-based analysis of the phosphoproteome of dermal microvascular endothelial cells revealed distinct sets of off-targets of the used BRAFi. Meanwhile, there were only negligible changes to the proteome after 1 h of treatment. Together with our published functional data, these findings provide insights on the surprisingly distinct side effects of BRAFi on endothelial signaling and functionality.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "DMEC from three donors (i1, i26, i29) were treated with Vemurafenib (10 or 100 \u00b5M), Dabrafenib, Encorafenib, or PLX8394 (all 10 \u00b5M), or vehicle control for 1 h. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS and protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktails and sonicated. Proteins were purified by ethanol-acetone-precipitation and resolubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC) in 50 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer, pH 8. For each sample, 150 \u00b5g proteins were digested with Lys-C (0.01 AU, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemicals Corp., Osaka, Japan) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and subsequently with trypsin (7.5 \u00b5g per sample) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. Peptides were labeled with a TMTpro 18-plex labeling kit (A52045, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All 18 samples were then pooled in equal amounts. After enrichment of phosphopeptides using TiO2 affinity chromatography, supernatants from incubation and wash steps were collected and further processed as \u201cnon-modified peptides\u201d. Non-modified peptides were purified using a commercial HLB cartridge that was equilibrated with ACN and 0.1% TFA, before loading and washing the sample with 0.1% TFA. Elution was performed with 65% ACN, 0.1% TFA solution, and samples were dried. Samples were dissolved in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 9.3, and loaded on an Acquity UPLC\u00ae-Class CSHTM C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). A total of 20 concatenated fractions was collected using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Analysis was performed on an Easy-nLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using buffer A (0.1% formic acid, FA) and buffer B (95% ACN, 0.1% FA) and an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All fractions were redissolved in buffer A (0.1% FA) and loaded into the in-house made fused silica capillary column setup (18 cm pulled emitter analytical column with 75 \u03bcm inner diameter, packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 3 \u03bcm (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany)). The peptides were eluted with gradient elution using a flowrate of 250 nl/min from 2% to 95% buffer B and were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition and positive ion mode mass spectrometry. The m/z scan range for full MS scan was 350 \u2013 1600 Da, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 120,000 FWHM, an AGC target value of 1 \u00d7 106 ions, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Further, the peptides were selected for collision-induced dissociation (CID), using fixed collision energy set to 35%. The fragment ion spectra were recorded using the Ion trap at a resolution of 15,000, an AGC target value of 1 \u00d7 105 MS2 ions and maximum injection time of 150 ms. MS3 spectra were acquired using synchronous precursor selection (SPS) of 10 precursors. MS3 precursors were fragmented by HCD with 55% of the collision energy and analyzed using the Orbitrap at 30,000 resolution power with a scan range of 100 - 500 m/z, an isolation window of 2 m/z, an AGC target value of 1 \u00d7 105 MS2, and maximum injection time of 120 ms with one microscan.",

                "projectDescription": "Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a co-receptor for various cytokines, including TGF-\u03b2, has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for fibrosis. However, its role and mechanism in renal fibrosis remains elusive. Here, we show that NRP1 is upregulated in distal tubular (DT) cells of patients with transplant renal insufficiency and mice with renal ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Knockout of Nrp1 reduced multiple endpoints of renal injury and fibrosis. We found that Nrp1 facilitates the binding of TNF-\u03b1 to its receptor in DT cells after renal injury. This signaling results in a downregulation of lysine crotonylation of the metabolic enzyme Cox4i1, decreased cellular energetics and exacerbation of renal injury. Furthermore, by single-cell RNA-sequencing we found that Nrp1-positive DT cells secrete collagen and communicate with myofibroblasts, exacerbating acute kidney injury (AKI)-induced renal fibrosis by activating Smad3. Dual genetic deletion of Nrp1 and Tgfbr1 in DT cells better improves renal injury and fibrosis than either single knockout. Together, these results reveal that targeting of NRP1 represents a promising strategy for the treatment of AKI and subsequent  chronic kidney disease",

Microglia, CNS-resident macrophages, modulate the brain through direct physical interactions and the secretion of molecules. One such secreted factor, the complement protein C1q, contributes to complement-mediated synapse elimination in development and disease models, yet brain C1q protein levels increase significantly throughout aging. How age-related C1q affects neuronal function has not been demonstrated. Here we report that C1q interacts with neuronal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in an age-dependent manner. Purified C1q protein undergoes RNA-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro, and the interaction of C1q with neuronal RNP complexes in vivo is dependent on RNA and endocytosis. Mice lacking C1q have age-specific alterations in neuronal protein synthesis in vivo and impaired fear memory extinction. Together, our findings reveal a biophysical property of C1q that underlies RNA- and age-dependent neuronal interactions and demonstrate a unique role of C1q in critical intracellular neuronal processes.",

The extracellular region of CI-MPR comprises 15 homologous domains with binding sites for M6P-containing ligands located in domains 3, 5, 9, and 15, whereas IGF2 interacts with residues in domain 11.  To evaluate the allosteric properties and conformation of CI-MPR, we isolated the receptor from a mammalian source, bovine serum and analyzed the sequence of the isolated receptor by mass spectrometry.",

In this study, we analyzed cancer data from the TCGA database, focusing particularly on the expression of the CDKN3 gene in LGG. The results showed that high CDKN3 expression in LGG patients was significantly associated with poor survival outcomes. Further gene expression analysis revealed that 379 genes were significantly upregulated in LGG samples with high CDKN3 expression, and these genes were primarily involved in the mitotic cell cycle and extracellular matrix organization. Additionally, high CDKN3 expression was closely linked to key signaling pathways such as tumor inflammation, hypoxic response, and tumor proliferation. Immune microenvironment analysis showed that high CDKN3 expression significantly increased the expression of CD4+ T cells and specific immune checkpoint genes, suggesting a potentially poor response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we confirmed that CDKN3 silencing significantly inhibited the proliferative capacity of LGG cells. Proteomics revealed that CDKN3 can bind ARG1 and upregulate intracellular arginine concentrations. These findings not only improve our understanding of LGG biology but also provide scientific evidence for developing potential therapeutic strategies targeting CDKN3.",

                "projectDescription": "Glycosylation, including N-glycosylation and O-glycosylation is generally characterized and controlled as a critical quality attribute for therapeutic glycoproteins because glycans can impact protein-based drug product efficacy, half-life, stability, and safety. Analytical procedures to characterize N-glycans are relatively well-established, but the characterization of O-glycans is challenging due to the complex workflows and lack of enzymatic tools. Here we present a simplified chemoenzymatic method to simultaneously profile N- and O-glycans from the same sample using a one-pot format by mass spectrometry (MS). N-glycans were first released by PNGase F, followed by O-glycopeptide generation by Proteinase K, selective N-glycan reduction, and O-glycan release by \u03b2-elimination during permethylation of both N- and O- glycans. Glycan structural assignments, and determination of N- to O-glycan ratio was obtained from the one-pot mass spectra. The streamlined, one-pot method is an accurate and reproducible approach that will facilitate advanced characterizations for quality assessments of therapeutic glycoproteins.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Fifty micograms of Bovine Fetuin was processed using a FASP protein digestion kit. Aliquots of Bovine Fetuin were brought up to 30 \u00b5L in 100mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.5 containing 10 mM DTT. Samples were denatured and reduced by incubation at 95\u00baC for 5 mins. After cooling to room temperature, samples were diluted to 100 \u00b5L with a solution of 8M urea supplemented with 40mM IAA and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes in the dark. Subsequently, 200 \u00b5L of 8M urea was added to the top of 30 kDa MWCO filter. The entire glycoprotein mixture was transferred to the tops of ultrafiltration devices and centrifuged at 15,000xg for 15 minutes. Filters were washed for a total of 3 times in 200 \u00b5L of 8M Urea, centrifuging at 15,000xg for 15 minutes after each wash. Filters were additionally washed for a total of three times in 200 \u00b5L of 50mM Ammonium Bicarbonate. After the final wash, 100 \u03bcL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate containing 1500 U of glycerol-free PNGase F was added to each sample. Samples were incubated at 37 oC for 16-18 hours. Following treatment with PNGaseF, the samples were centrifuged at 15,000xg for 15 minutes and the flowthrough containing released N-glycans was discarded. Filters were washed with 10% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA. Filters were then washed with 200 \u00b5L of 50mM TEAB for a total of three times. After the final wash filters were transferred to fresh collection tubes and 100 \u00b5L of 50mM TEAB containing 1 \u00b5g of trypsin was added to each sample. Samples were incubated at 37 oC for 16-18 hours. In the morning, peptides were eluted by centrifugation at 15,000xg for 15 minutes and the filters were washed once with 100 \u00b5L of 0.1% TFA.  Eluted peptides were dried down in a SpeedVac and subsequently reconstituted in 50 \u00b5L of 20mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Subsequently, 5 \u00b5L of IMPa was added to the sample and samples were digested for 16-18 hours at 37\u00b0C.  To remove IMPa from the sample, peptides were passed through a 30 kDa centrifugal filter and the flowthrough containing digested peptides was retained. Peptides were dried down in a SpeedVac and subsequently reconstituted in 100 \u00b5L of 0.1% TFA in preparation for C18 SPE. C18 columns were activated by washing with 200 \u00b5L of 50%/0.1% acetonitrile/TFA for a total of five times, centrifuging at 1,000xg for 2 mins in-between each wash. C18 columns were equilibrated by washing with 200 \u00b5L of 0.1% TFA for a total of 3 times, centrifuging at 1,000xg for 2 mins in-between each wash. Columns were transferred to fresh collection tubes and peptide samples were applied to the top. C18 columns were centrifuged at 1,000xg for 2 mins and the flowthrough was reapplied to the column for a total of five times; in order to maximize recovery of glycopeptides. Bound peptides were washed with 200 \u00b5L of 0.1% TFA for a total of three times. C18 columns were transferred to fresh collection tubes and peptides were eluted with 50 \u00b5L of 50%/0.1% acetonitrile/TFA. Eluted peptides were dried in a SpeedVac and prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis. (Glyco)peptides were analyzed as described previously with minor modification. Dried peptides were reconstituted in 200 \u00b5L of 0.1% TFA. Peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Eclipse Tribrid mass spectrometer and approximately 1 \u00b5g of the peptide mixture was injected per LC-MS/MS run. (Glyco)peptides were separated on an Acclaim PepMap C18 RLSC nanoviper column over a 60 minute run. Solvent A was 5%/0.1% ACN/FA and Solvent B was 0.1% FA in acetonitrile. The gradient increased from 0% to 90% B over the first 45 minutes at a flow rate of 0.3 \u00b5L/min. The gradient was held at 90% B from 45 minutes to 50 minutes at a flow rate of 0.3 \u00b5L/min. The gradient was then decreased from 90% B to 5% from 50 minutes to 55 minutes and held at 5% B from 55 minutes to 60 minutes. The column temperature was set to 35\u00b0C. Survey scans of peptide precursors were collected in the Orbitrap from 400-2000 Th with an AGC target set to standard, a maximum injection time set to auto, RF lens at 30%, and a resolution of 120,000 at 200 m/z. Monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled for peptide isotopic distributions, precursors were selected for data-dependent MS/MS scans for 12 dependent scans and dynamic exclusion was set to 30 seconds with a \u00b110 ppm window. Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) \u201cscouting\u201d MS/MS scans were performed at 36% normalized collision energy (nce) and an orbitrap resolution of 30,000 for a maximum injection time of 60ms, an AGC target set to standard and a scan range set to auto. Product-dependent EThCD child scans were triggered by the following oxonium ion m/z ratios (204.09, 366.14, 126.055, 138.0549, 144.0655, 168.0654, 186.076, 274.0921, 292.1027) with a low and high mass tolerance of 10 ppm and 25 ppm. EThCD scans were carried out using a supplemental activation of 25% nce, a maximum injection time of 54ms, and an orbitrap resolution of 30,000. AGC target was set to standard and scan range was set to auto.",

[PMID: 33106676] Raw files were searched using a FASTA file containing Uniprot derived sequences of bovine fetuin A and common contaminants [PMID: 36408920]. Protein sequences were digested with Trypsin/IMPa were IMPa digests N-terminally to serine or threonine residues. The calibrate task was enabled with a maximum of eight missed cleavages and a precursor mass tolerance of 15 ppm and a product tolerance of 25 ppm. A carbamidomethyl modification on cysteine was set as fixed and methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification. The global PTM discovery (GPTMD) task was enabled using the default list of common biological and common artifact modifications. The O-glycosearch task was enabled using a database of 22 O-glycans. The maximum number of glycans allowed per peptide was set to six and oxonium ion filtering was enabled. The parent scan type was set to HCD and the child scan type was set to EthcD. Final results were obtained by filtering the identified sites to retain only those with a level 1 confidence (site localization supported by fragment ions).",

                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Major ampullate (MA) glands Spiders were anesthetized, dissected and MA glands were carefully pulled out by holding the duct. A cut was made in the sac of the gland allowing the dope to flow out for 15 min. The glands were washed thrice with PBS and transferred to a low-binding 1.5 mL microtube (Axygen) containing 60 \u00b5L of 8M urea in 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8, vortexed and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath sonicator (VWR) for 30 min at RT. The samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until further use. Three biological replicates were used for the final protein sequencing.  Samples were supplemented with 0.2% ProteaseMAX (Promega) in 20% ACN/20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 to get 4M urea concentration before water bath sonication for 5 min. Proteins were reduced with 8 mM DTT incubated at 24\u00b0C for 1 h with 550 rpm and alkylated with 20 mM chloroacetamide (CAA) incubated for 1 hour at RT in dark. Digestion was started with addition of 2 \u00b5g of LysC (Wako, Japan) incubated at 24\u00b0C for 2 h and completed with 2 \u00b5g sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight (ca 16 h). Following centrifugation, the supernatants were collected, and proteolysis was stopped with 5% FA, and the samples were cleaned on a C18 Hypersep plate with 40 \u00b5L bed volume (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dried using a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf).  MA silk fibers For collecting the silk, each spider was anesthetized with CO2 and gently pinned down to immobilize. The MA silk was identified, pulled out from the anterior spinneret. Several spiders were used to collect enough amount of silk for the experiments. After silking, the spiders were fed with fruit flies, watered, and not used again for the next two weeks.  The collected silk was treated in three different ways for solubilization. About 450 \u00b5g of silk was taken for each set of samples and every treatment was performed for 3 replicates. In the first method, the silk was dissolved in 100 \u00b5L of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and brief vortexing. The samples were then sonicated in an ultrasonic bath sonicator (VWR) for 30 min at room temperature. The HFIP was evaporated on a Centrivap concentrator system (Labconco). The protein was resuspended in 60 \u00b5L of 8M urea in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8. In the second treatment the silk was dissolved in 60 \u00b5L of 8M urea in 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 and sonicated. For the third method, the silk was dissolved in 60 \u00b5L of 9M LiBr in 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 and sonicated. Low-binding 1.5 mL microtubes (Axygen) were used throughout the experiments.  An aliquot of 30 \u00b5L samples (ca 10 \u00b5g) was taken to further preparation. From samples with the HFIP and urea methods, proteins were reduced with 3 \u00b5L of 100 mM DTT, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 h with 1200 rpm and alkylated with 5 \u00b5L of 500 mM CAA incubated for 30 min at room temperature in dark. Half of the samples were supplemented with 19 \u00b5L of 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5 and digested with addition of 1 \u00b5g of LysC (Wako, Japan) incubated at 24\u00b0C for 2 h. Digestion was continued with 1 \u00b5g sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega) after addition of 56 \u00b5L of Tris-HCl and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight (ca 16 h). Samples with the third method (LiBr) were prepared similarly, except for 2 \u00b5L of 500 mM DTT was used for reduction incubated at 95\u00b0C for 30 min with shaking at 12,500 rpm. Alkylation with 5 \u00b5L of 500 mM CAA (as above) was followed by digestion with LysC and trypsin as described above except for that 3 \u00b5g trypsin was used. The digestion of all samples was stopped with 6.5 \u00b5L concentrated formic acid, the samples were cleaned on a C18 Hypersep plate with 40 \u00b5L bed volume (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and dried using a vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf).  Layer-wise dissolution of MA silk fibers The MA silk was collected, as mentioned above, in pre-weighed low-binding microtubes. The collected silk was divided into 3 sets treated with: 1) 2M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.5M NaCl, 2) 4M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.5M NaCl, and 3) 8M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl and 0.5M NaCl. Samples were sonicated at room temperature for 2 \u2013 3 h followed by centrifugation at 17,000 g. The supernatant was collected and stored at -20\u00b0C before using for proteomics analysis. To make sure that the results obtained from sequential solubilization of the silk was not solely due to the relative solubility of the proteins in urea, the following experiment was performed: Two separate samples of the silk weighing 600 \u00b5g each were solubilized in 300 \u00b5L of formic acid each by vortexing. Each solubilized silk sample was then divided in three low-binding microtubes and subjected to speed vacuum for an hour. The obtained dried samples were further subjected to treatment with: 1) 2M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 2) 4M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl, and 3) 8M urea in 50 mM Tris-HCl, respectively. The urea-treated samples were sonicated at room temperature for 2 \u2013 3 h followed by centrifugation at 17,000 g. The supernatant was collected and used for proteomics analysis.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Data Acquisition Peptides were reconstituted in solvent A and injected on a 50 cm long EASY-Spray C18 column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) connected to an UltiMate 3000 nano-flow UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 90 min long gradient: 4-26% of solvent B (98% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA) in 90 min, 26-95% in 5 min, and 95% of solvent B for 5 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Mass spectra were acquired on a Q Exactive HF hybrid quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ranging from m/z 375 to 1800 at a resolution of R=120,000 (at m/z 200) targeting 5x106 ions for maximum injection time of 100 ms, followed by data-dependent higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) fragmentations of precursor ions with a charge state 2+ to 7+, using 45 s dynamic exclusion. The tandem mass spectra of the top 17 precursor ions were acquired with a resolution of R=30,000, targeting 2x105 ions for maximum injection time of 54 ms, setting quadrupole isolation width to 1.4 Th and normalized collision energy to 28%.  Analysis of proteomics data Acquired raw data files were converted to Mascot Generic File (mgf) format using an in-house developed tool, Raw2MGF (version 2.1.3), and searched with Mascot Daemon version 2.5.1 (Matrix Science Ltd., UK) against a protein database obtained from 22860 protein entries. A maximum of two missed cleavage sites were allowed for full tryptic digestion, while setting the precursor and the fragment ion mass tolerance to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified as a fixed modification, while oxidation on methionine as well as deamidation of asparagine and glutamine were set as dynamic modifications. The search results were imported into Scaffold version 4.11 (Proteome Software Inc.) to calculate the contribution of each protein to the total sum of spectra (percentage of total spectra). For all proteins were there was no report of a percentage of total spectra for a sample the percentage of total spectra value was set to 0.  To identify the proteins in the silk we used MS/MS data from both the silk fibers and the glands. To determine their presence in the gland, the average percent of total spectra for each protein was calculated by taking the mean of the three gland samples. All proteins that were reported in at least one of the samples were considered to be present in the gland. The average percent of total spectra for each protein in the silk was calculated similarly by taking the mean of the nine samples, i.e., three biological replicates for the three different solvents (HFIP, LiBr, urea). For a protein to be considered present in the major ampullate silk, four criteria had to be fulfilled: 1) it had to present in the gland, 2) it had to be found in at least two of the detergents, 3) it had possess a signal-peptide predicted at the 5\u2019 end of its aa sequence, and 4) it had to have an average percent of total spectra greater than 0.15. After applying these criteria, 18 proteins remained. The relative molecular abundance of proteins in the three HFIP silk samples was calculated using three different methods. MaxQuant (version 2.5.2.0) employed intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) and label-free quantification (LFQ) to determine protein relative abundance. Additionally, Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) values, based on spectral counts, were obtained using Scaffold (version 5.3.3). Statistical differences in the percentage of total spectra for a protein between different urea concentrations were determined using an unpaired t-test, focusing on these 18 proteins. Relative percent of total spectra for the 18 silk proteins were estimated for urea extracts from fibers dissolved in formic acid and compared with those obtained from urea extracts of intact silk fibers.",

                "projectDescription": "Autophagy, involved in protein degradation and amino acid recycling, plays a key role in plant development and stress responses. However, the relationship between autophagy and phytohormones is unclear.   We used diverse methods, including CRISPR/Cas9, UPLC-MS/MS, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and dual-luciferase assays to explore the molecular mechanism of strigolactones in regulating autophagy and the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins under cold stress in tomato.  We show that cold stress induced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Mutants deficient in strigolactone biosynthesis were more sensitive to cold stress with a higher accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, while treatment with the synthetic strigolactone analog GR245DS enhanced cold tolerance in tomato, with a higher accumulation of autophagosomes and transcripts of autophagy-related genes (ATGs), and a lower accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Meanwhile, cold stress induced ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) accumulation, which was triggered by strigolactones. HY5 further trans-activated ATG18a promoter, resulting in autophagy formation. Mutation of ATG18a compromised strigolactone-induced cold tolerance, followed by a decreased formation of autophagosomes and an increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.  These findings reveal that strigolactones positively regulate autophagy in an HY5-dependent manner and promote the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins under cold conditions in tomato.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Ubiquitinated protein extraction was performed by using urea buffer containing 100 mM Tris/HCl and 8 M urea. Dithiothreitol (10 mM final concentration) was added and mixed with the sample at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. When the sample was cooled to room temperature, iodoacetamide (IAA, 50 mM final concentration) was added to incubate for 30 min in dark conditions. Trypsin was selected to digest the proteins at 37\u00b0C overnight, afterwards, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added with a 0.1% final concentration. The digested peptides were then desalted on C18 Cartridges (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and lyophilized. The lyophilized samples were subsequently reconstituted in precooled immunoaffinity purification (IAP) buffer, then pretreated anti-K-\u03b5-GG antibody beads (PTMScan Ubiquitin Remnant Motif (K-\u03b5-GG) Kit, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) were added and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. After centrifugation at 2,000 g for 30 s, the supernatant was discarded. Anti-K-\u03b5-GG antibody beads were then washed with 1 mL IAP buffer three times, followed by three washes with precooled water. TFA (0.15%, 40 \u00b5L) was added to the beads to incubate for 10 min, and the same TFA was added and centrifuged again. Finally, the supernatant was desalted via the C18 STAGE Tips.",

                "projectDescription": "PFAS are persistent man-made chemicals considered to be emerging pollutants, with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS having associations with liver toxicity and steatosis. PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS can undergo placental/lactational transfer, however, little is known about the impact of PFAS mixtures during the developmental window, nor maternal diet on PFAS adverse effects. It was hypothesized that gestational/lactational PFAS exposure would alter the pup liver proteome. The work herein evaluated the liver proteome in offspring, identifying potential biochemical/signaling pathways altered via maternal PFAS exposure. Timed-pregnant CD-1 dams were fed a standard chow or 60% kcal high-fat diet. From GD1 until PND20, dams were orally gavaged daily with either 0.5% Tween 20, individual PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS at 1 mg/kg, or a mixture (1 mg/kg each, totaling 3 mg/kg). Livers were collected from PND21 offspring and SWATH-MS pro-teomics was performed. IPA analysis revealed disease and biological function pathways involved in liver damage, xenobiotics, and lipid regulation were modulated by PFAS exposure in the PND21 liver: lipid transport, storage, oxidation, and synthesis, xenobiotic metabolism and transport, liver damage and inflammation, and fatty acid metabolism, oxidation and transport. This indicates the pup liver proteome is altered via maternal exposure and predisposes the pup to metabolic dysfunctions.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "After protein concentration was determined by BCA assay, the homogenates were di-luted to a concentration of 2 mg/mL protein/sample for a starting volume of 100 \u00b5L. Then, each sample was spiked with 10 \u00b5L of 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin [BSA] and denatured with the addition of 25 \u00b5L of 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in a shaking water bath (100 rpm) for 15 minutes. Following denaturation, the samples were then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes with 25 \u00b5L of iodoacetamide (IAA) to reduce cysteine residues to the sulfhydryl form. Next, 250 \u00b5L of MilliQ-purified water and 500 \u00b5L of ice-cold methanol were added to each sample, followed by 250 \u00b5L of ice-cold chloroform to precipitate out protein and remove lipids and nucleic acids. The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes at 10\uf0b0C to create a phase separa-tion. Once finished, a protein pellet in between the aqueous and organic layers was formed. All liquid was removed and the pellet was subsequently washed very gently with 500 \u00b5L ice-cold methanol and briefly dried before adding in 130 \u00b5L of sodium deoxycholate (NaDOC) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (3% w/v solution) to lyse the proteins. A tube of lyophilized trypsin was then resuspended with 500 \u00b5L of Mil-liQ-purified water. From there, 12.5 \u00b5L of lyophilized trypsin was added to each sample, vortexed, and 138 \u00b5L of the sample was added to a MT-96 PCT Micro-TubesTM (Pressure BioScience Inc, South Easton, MA) before being placed in the Barocycler NEP2320 PCT Sample Preparation System (Source Scientific, Irvine, CA). The barocycler program used was: Time 1 = 50 seconds, Time 2 = 10 seconds, Pressure = 35 psi, Temp = 33oC, Cycles = 75 (run one) and 60 (run two). A Haake SC 100 (Ther-moFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) water bath was utilized to bring the water up to temp for use in the barocycler. The samples were then subjected to the barocycler for run one, then 12.5 \u00b5L of lyophilized trypsin was added before samples were subjected the barocycler for a second run. Then, 135 \u00b5L of sample and 15 \u00b5L of 5% formic acid were added to a microcentrifuge tube, vortexed, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 10\uf0b0C . After centrifugation, 75-100 \u00b5L of the supernatant was very carefully removed and transferred into HPLC vials. A SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF mass spectrometer in positive electrospray ionization mode equipped with a DuoSpray ion source (SCIEX, Concord, Canada) coupled to Acquity UHPLC HClass system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA) was used to acquire pup liver sample data. SWATH\u2013MS allows for retrospective mining of data by creating a digital repository of fragmented precursors within a predefined m/z. A mouse refer-ence spectral library is then used for comparison against the generated dataset and Spectronaut software transforms the raw data output into tangible protein intensities. The peptides were differentiated on an Acquity UHPLC Peptide BEH C18 (2.1 \u00d7 150 mm2, 300 \u00c5, 1.7 \u03bcm) equipped with Acquity VanGuard precolumn (2.1 \u00d7 5 mm2, 300 \u00c5, 1.7 \u03bcm), with the analytical column temperature kept at 40\u00b0C. Chromatographic separation was achieved with a linear gradient method runtime of 60 min at 100 \u03bcL/min. Mobile phase A was composed of 98% MilliQ-purified water, 2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B contained 98% acetonitrile, 2% MilliQ-purified water, 0.1% formic acid. The method ran as follows: 0 to 3 min (98% A), 4 - 48 min (60% to 90% A), 49 - 52 min (20% A), from 53 - 60 min (98% A). The last 7 minutes of the method at 98% A allowed for the column to equilibrate before the start of next run. Samples were kept at 10\u00b0C in the autosampler and 10 \u03bcg of protein was loaded onto the column per injection. In between each batch of samples (~47 samples/batch), trypsin-digested \u03b2-galactosidase peptides were injected (\u223c30 pmol/injection) to moni-tor mass calibration of the TOF detector and normalization of intensity during relative quantification.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Spectronaut (Biognosys, 8952 Schlieren, Switzerland) was utilized to process the resulting data files from the SWATH-MS runs. The .raw files from Analyst (Sciex, Framingham, USA) were converted into an HTRMS file format utilizing HTRMS Convert (Biognosys, 8952 Schlieren, Switzerland) in Spectronaut. A reference spectral library from the UP000000589_mice reference protein database was generated and then compared against samples. The DIA analysis was performed with the factory settings set to default, with minor changes - trypsin/P was selected for the peptide\u2019s enzyme/cleavage rules, single hit proteins were excluded, and mus musculus (MGI) was specified for gene annotation. The resulting file is then exported for analysis. The exported file from Spectronaut was processed in Microsoft Excel 365. The raw intensities were converted to pmol/mg protein utilizing the total protein approach (TPA) as previously published (Wi\u015bniewski et al., 2014). Tukey\u2019s outlier test was conducted and outliers were removed (IQR = \u00b11.5), then a two-tailed heteroscedastic Student\u2019s t-test (p-value \u2264 0.05) was performed. The samples\u2019 fold change (FC) and Log2 fold change (Log2FC) were then calculated for determining up/down regulation of proteins.",

                "projectDescription": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most fatal form of lung cancer. Intra-tumoral heterogeneity, marked by neuroendocrine (NE) and non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) cell states, defines SCLC, but the drivers of SCLC plasticity are poorly understood. To map the landscape of SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), we apply spatially resolved transcriptomics and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to metastatic SCLC tumors obtained via rapid autopsy. The phenotype and overall composition of non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibits substantial variability, closely mirroring the tumor phenotype, suggesting TME-driven reprogramming of NE cell states. We identify cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) as a crucial element of SCLC TME heterogeneity, contributing to immune exclusion, and predicting an exceptionally poor prognosis. Together, our work provides the first comprehensive map of SCLC tumor and TME ecosystems, emphasizing their pivotal role in SCLCs adaptable nature, opening possibilities for re-programming the intercellular communications that shape SCLC tumor states.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Consecutive tissue thin sections (8 \u03bcm) were generated by microtome, placed onto polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) membrane slides, and stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Cellular enrichment via laser microdissection (LMD) was performed on the LMD7 (Leica Microsystems) for selective harvest of tumor and TME regions from each of the 15 tissue specimens. LMD enriched samples in 20 \u00b5l 100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate / 10% acetonitrile were pressure-assisted, trypsin-digested using pressure cycling technology (PCT; Pressure Biosciences, Inc.). Briefly, LMD samples were incubated at 99 \u00b0C for 30 min followed by 50 \u00b0C for 10 min with SMART trypsin (ThermoFisher Scientific). SMART trypsin was added at a ratio of 1 \u03bcg per 30 mm2 tissue. Lysis and digestion were performed in a Barocycler 2320EXT (Pressure Biosciences, Inc.) by cycling between 45 kpsi for 50 sec and atmospheric pressure for 10 sec, for 60 cycles at 50 \u00b0C. Peptide digests were quantified by colorimetric assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit). Digested peptides (10 \u00b5g) from each sample (n=15 LMD enriched tumor and n=13 LMD enriched TME samples) were labeled using isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT), per manufacturer\u2019s instructions (TMTpro 18-plex Isobaric Label Reagent Set, ThermoFisher Scientific). A reference sample was generated by pooling equivalent amounts of peptide digests from each of the patient samples and included in each TMTpro-18 multiplex. TMT-labeled samples were pooled within respective multiplexes, cleaned using the EasyPep Maxi MS Sample Prep Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and fractionated offline to 36 pooled fractions via basic reversed-phase liquid chromatography (bRPLC). The TMTpro-18 bRPLC fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing a nanoflow LC system (EASY-nLC 1200, ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled online with a Q Exactive HF-X MS (ThermoFisher Scientific).",

Peptide spectral match (PSM) results were filtered using a <1.0% false discovery rate (FDR). Log2-transformed PSM abundances were calculated using z-score transformation for each TMT-18 channel relative to the pooled reference standard. Protein-level abundances were calculated from the normalized log2-transformed TMT reporter ion ratio abundances from \u22652 PSMs corresponding to a single protein accession. Protein-level abundances were imputed for proteins absent from individual patient samples, but present in \u226550% of all patient samples.",

In this study, we develop a strategy to generate a well-controlled XL-MS standard by systematically mixing and cross-linking recombinant proteins. The standard can be split into independent datasets, each of which has the MS2-level complexity of a typical proteome-wide XL-MS experiment. The raw datasets included in this submission were used to (1) guide the development of Scout, a machine learning-based search engine for XL-MS with MS-cleavable cross-linkers (batch 1), test different LC-MS acquisition methods (batch 2), and directly compare Scout to widely used XL-MS search engines (batches 3 and 4).",

In brief, all proteins are His-tagged at the C-termini, packaged in PC3.1 expression plasmid, and produced in E.coli. Lyophilized proteins were dissolved in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.8 at concentrations varying from 0.1 \u2013 1.5 mg/mL. The dissolved proteins were mixed in pairs of two proteins according to a defined mixing scheme and incubated for 20 min at 50 \u00b0C to induce interactions in vitro. 0.2 \u2013 1 mM DSSO cross-linking reagent was added to the groups and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 for 30 min at room temperature. Consequently, all groups were merged, and 8 M Urea was added to the solution. The protein mixture was reduced with 5 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, alkylated in the dark with 40 mM CAA for 30 min at room temperature and digested with 1:200 (wt/wt) Lys-C for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C, shaking. After dilution with three volumes 20 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 1:100 (wt/wt) Trypsin was added and incubated over night at 37 \u00b0C. The digestion was stopped by adding 1% FA. Peptides were desalted with Sep-Pak C8 cartridges (Waters) and the peptide concentration was determined using Pierce colorimetric peptide assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The desalted peptides were dried and stored at \u201220 \u00b0C until further use. Peptides were loaded onto a PolySULFOETHYL A column (PolyLC INC.) on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II system and separated with a 90 min gradient. All fractions were desalted using C8 StageTips. Desalted SCX fractions and high-pH separated enriched phospho peptides were resuspended in 1% ACN, 0.05% TFA and 1 \u00b5g peptides were injected into a Thermo Scientific\u2122 Dionex\u2122 UltiMate\u2122 3000 system connected to a PepMap C-18 trap-column (0.075 mm x 50 mm, 3 \u03bcm particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size (ThermoFisher Scientific)) followed by an in-house packed C18 column for reverse phase separation (Poroshell 120 EC-C18, 2.7 \u03bcm (Agilent Technologies)) at 300 nL/min flow rate. Peptides were separated using a 180 min gradient and analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer with FAIMS Pro\u2122 device (Thermo Scientific) and Instrument Control Software version 3.4. MS1 and MS2 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap with a mass resolution of 120,000 and 60,000 respectively. MS1 scan range was set to m/z 375 \u2013 1600, standard AGC target, 50 ms maximum injection time and 60 s dynamic exclusion. MS2 scans were set to an AGC target of 1e5, 118 ms injection time, isolation window 1.6 m/z. Only cross-linked precursors at charged states +4 to +8 were subjected to MS2. Peptides were fragmented using stepped collision energy SCE 27 \u00b1 6%. Data were acquired using 2 s per CV with an internal stepping of CVs from -50 to -60 and -75.",

Here, we investigate how altering OGT\u2019s TPR domain impacts cell growth after the endogenous enzyme is deleted. We find that disrupting the TPR residues required for OGT dimerization leads to faster cell growth, whereas truncating the TPR domain slows cell growth.We also find that OGT requires eight of its 13 TPRs to sustain cell viability. OGT-8, like the nonviable shorter OGT variants, is mislocalized and has reduced Ser/Thr glycosylation activity; moreover, its interactions with most of wild-type OGT\u2019s binding partners are broadly attenuated.",

Peptide spectral matches (PSMs) were altered to a 1% FDR (2,3). PSM filtering was performed using a linear discriminant analysis, as described previously (4), while considering the following parameters: XCorr, \u0394Cn, missed cleavages, peptide length, charge state, and precursor mass accuracy. Peptide-spectral matches were identified, quantified, and collapsed to a 1% FDR and then further collapsed to a final protein- level FDR of 1%. Furthermore, protein assembly was guided by principles of parsimony to produce the smallest set of proteins necessary to account for all observed peptides. Spectral counts were then extracted and the data were subsequently analyzed.",

                "projectDescription": "3D tumoroids have revolutionized in vitro/ex vivo cancer biology by recapitulating the complex diversity of tumors. While tumoroid provide new insights into cancer development and treatment response, several limitations remain. The tumor microenvironment, especially the immune system, strongly influences tumor development. Absence of immune cells in tumoroids may yield flawed conclusions. Macrophages, key players in tumor progression, pose integration challenges into tumoroid. In this study, we established three optimized and standardized methods for co-culturing human macrophages with breast cancer tumoroids: a semi-liquid model and two matrix-embedded models tailored for specific applications. Optimizing culture conditions, we tracked interactions and macrophage infiltration using flow cytometry and light sheet microscopy. Macrophages not only influenced tumoroid molecular profiles but also chemotherapy response. This underscores the importance of increasing the complexity of current 3D models to more accurately reflect in vivo conditions. The three models have different application and can be used in various ways.",

Initially, the sample was treated with a reduction solution containing 100 mM DTT in 8 M urea in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.5 (UA buffer) and incubated for 15 min at 95\u00b0C. Subsequently, the protein solution was loaded onto 10 kDa Amicon filters, followed by the addition of 200 \u03bcL of UA buffer and centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 g. Subsequently, 200 \u03bcL of UA buffer was added to the filter and centrifuged for another 30 min at 14,000 g. Next, 100 \u03bcL of alkylation solution (0.05 M iodoacetamide in UA buffer) was applied and incubated for 20 min in the dark, followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 g. Afterward, a 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution (AB) was added and centrifuged again for 30 min at 14,000 g. This step was repeated three time. For the digestion process, 50 \u03bcL LysC/Trypsin at 20 \u03bcg/mL in AB buffer was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. The digested peptides were recovered after centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 g. Then, two washes with 100 \u00b5L of AB buffer were performed by centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 g. Finally, the eluted peptides were acidified with 10 \u00b5l of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and dried under vacuum. LC-MS/MS analysis The dried samples were reconstituted in 20 \u03bcL of a 0.1% TFA solution and 5 \u03bcL of sample was desalted using an Evotip Pure\u2122 (Evosep, Odense, Denmark). Then, the peptides was separated and analysed by Evosep One LC system coupled to a timsTOF Flex (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) mass spectrometer. The Evosep One system operated with 60 Samples Per Day (60 SPD) method using an 8 cm x 150 \u00b5m reverse-phase column maintained at 40\u00b0C. Analytical columns were connected using a fused silica ID emitter (10 \u03bcm ID; Bruker Daltonics) within a Captive spray source (Bruker).

                "title": "Docking a flexible basket onto the core of the nuclear pore complex",
                "projectDescription": "The nuclear basket attaches to the nucleoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), coupling transcription to mRNA quality control and export. The basket expands the functional repertoire of a subset of NPCs in S. cerevisiae by drawing a unique RNA/protein interactome. Yet, how the basket docks onto the NPC core remains unknown. By integrating AlphaFold-powered interaction screens, electron microscopy and membrane-templated reconstitution, we uncovered a membrane-anchored tripartite junction between basket and NPC core. The basket subunit Nup60 harbours three adjacent short linear motifs (SLiMs) which connect Mlp1, a parallel homodimer consisting of coiled-coil segments interrupted by flexible hinges, and the Nup85 subunit of the Y-complex. We reconstituted the Y-complex\u2022Nup60\u2022Mlp1 assembly on a synthetic membrane and validated the protein interfaces in vivo. Our study explains how a SLiM-based protein junction can substantially reshape NPC structure and function, advancing our understanding of compositional and conformational NPC heterogeneity.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Y-complex (also known as Nup84 complex in yeast) was purified from S. cerevisiae NUP133-SNAP-TAP \u0394nup60 strain following one-step affinity (IgG beads) purification protocol. The native elution was performed using TEV protease in 100mM NaCl, 50mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.5mM DTT buffer.  Recombinant Nup60, Nup85*\u00b7Seh1 and Mlp1 N60BD constructs, namely, GST-Nup60(200-318)-StrepII, GST-Nup60(267-284), GST-Nup60(285-318), NusA-His6-TEV-Mlp1(382-620) and Nup85(1-564)\u00b7His6-Seh1 were expressed and purified from E. coli. GST-Nup60(267-284) and GST-Nup60(285-318) were affinity purified on GSH beads from E.coli lysates with all purifications steps performed using 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.2), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT buffer.

Lysis buffer was supplemented with 0.15% (v/v) IGEPAL\u00ae CA-630.  After buffer exchange to 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.2), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM DTT buffer, proteins were mixed, incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and cross-linked with DSS (in case of the Y-complex, isotopically coded disuccinimidyl suberate (1:1 molar mix of DSS-H12/D12, Creative Molecules) was used). Cross-linking with DMSO-solubilized DSS was performed for 30 min at 30\u00b0C, quenching reaction with 1M Tris (pH 8.0) for 10 min. Cross-linked samples were mixed with 4xSB, boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The Coomassie-stained gel band was destained with a mixture of acetonitrile (VWR) and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma). The proteins were reduced using 10 mM dithiothreitol (Roche) and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma). Trypsin (Promega; Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade) was used for proteolytic cleavage. Digestion was carried out at 37\u00b0C overnight. Formic acid (Fisher chemical) was used to stop the digestion and peptides were extracted using a mixture of acetonitrile and formic acid. Extracts were speedvacced until dryness and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Thermo Scientific) 2% acetonitrile.   Peptides were separated on a ultimate 3000 nano-flow chromatography system (Thermo-Fisher), using a pre-column for sample loading (Acclaim PepMap C18, 2 cm \u00d7 0.1 mm, 5 \u03bcm, Thermo-Fisher), and a C18 analytical column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 50 cm \u00d7 0.75 mm, 2 \u03bcm, Thermo-Fisher), applying a segmented linear gradient from 2% to 35% and finally 80% solvent B (80 % acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid; solvent A 0.1 % formic acid) at a flow rate of 230 nL/min over 120min .  Eluting peptides were analyzed on an Exploris 480 Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) using coated emitter tips (PepSep, MSWil) with the following settings: The mass spectrometer was operated in DDA mode with the FAIMS CV set to -40, -55 and -70. The cycle time was set to 1 s. The survey scans were obtained in a mass range of 375-1600 m/z, at a resolution of 120k at 200 m/z, and a normalized AGC target at 100%. The selected ions were isolated with a width of 1.2 m/z, fragmented in the HCD cell at 27%, 30%, 33% collision energy, and the spectra recorded for max. 200 ms at a normalized AGC target of 200% and a resolution of 30k. Peptides with a charge of +3 to +8 were included for fragmentation, the peptide match feature was set to preferred, the exclude isotope feature was enabled, and selected precursors were dynamically excluded from repeated sampling for 30 seconds.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Data analysis Raw data were converted per cv into raw files in Freestyle and searched using the MaxQuant software package (2.0.3.0) against the target sequences, the Uniprot E.coli and yeast reference proteome (www.uniprot.org) as well as a database of most common contaminants. The search was performed with standard identification settings: full trypsin specificity allowing a maximum of two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as fixed, oxidation of methionine and acetylation of protein N-termini as variable modifications. All other settings were left at default. Results were filtered at a false discovery rate of 1% at protein and peptide spectrum match level.   pLink To identify cross-linked peptides, the spectra were searched using pLink software (version 2.3.9) against the sequences of the top 10 non-contaminant proteins from the MQ search sorted by iBAQ. DSS and DSS-D12 were selected as the cross-linking chemistry. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was set as fixed, oxidation of Met, and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was selected according to the protease used for digestion. Search results were filtered for 1% FDR on the PSM level limiting the precursor mass deviation to 10 ppm. To remove low-quality peptide spectrum matches an additional e-Value cutoff of < 0.001 was applied. Cross-link maps were generated in xiNET.   XiSearch To identify cross-linked peptides, the spectra were searched using XiSearch software (1.7.6.7) against the sequences of the top 10 non-contaminant proteins from the MQ search sorted by iBAQ. DSS and DSS-D12 were selected as the cross-linking chemistry. Carbamidomethyl on Cys was set as fixed, oxidation of Met, and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications. Enzyme specificity was selected according to the protease used for digestion. Search results were filtered in XiFDR with 5% FDR for residue pairs limiting the precursor mass deviation to 15 ppm.

                "projectDescription": "Proteins secreted by marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus under phosphorus stress is largely uncharacterized. This dataset characterizes the exoproteins for both an open ocean (WH8102) and coastal (WH5701) Synechococcus strain and were collected as part of the study \"Dissolved organic phosphorus bond-class utilization by Synechococcus\".   Study Abstract: Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) contains compounds with phosphoester (P-O-C), phosphoanhydride (P-O-P), and phosphorus-carbon (P-C) bonds. Despite DOP\u2019s importance as a nutritional source for marine microorganisms, the bioavailability of each bond-class to the widespread cyanobacterium Synechococcus remains largely unknown. This study evaluates bond-class specific DOP utilization by cultures of an open ocean and a coastal ocean Synechococcus strain. Both strains exhibited comparable growth rates when provided phosphate, short-chain and long-chain polyphosphate (P-O-P), adenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate (P-O-C and P-O-P), and glucose-6-phosphate (P-O-C) as the phosphorus source. However, growth rates on phosphomonoester adenosine 5\u2019-monophosphate (P-O-C) and phosphodiester bis(4-methylumbelliferyl) phosphate (C-O-P-O-C) varied between strains, and neither strain grew on selected phosphonates. Consistent with the growth measurements, both strains preferentially hydrolyzed 3-polyphosphate, followed by adenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate, and then adenosine 5\u2019-monophosphate. The strains\u2019 exoproteome contained phosphorus hydrolases, which combined with enhanced cell-free hydrolysis of 3-polyphosphate and adenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate under phosphate deficiency, suggests active mineralization of short-chain polyphosphate by Synechococcus\u2019 exoproteins. Synechococcus alkaline phosphatases presented broad substrate specificities, including activity towards short-chain polyphosphate, with varying affinities between the two strains. Collectively, these findings underscore the potentially significant role of compounds with phosphoanhydride bonds in Synechococcus phosphorus nutrition, thereby expanding our understanding of microbially-mediated DOP cycling in marine ecosystems.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Axenic Synechococcus WH8102 (open ocean strain) and WH5701 (coastal strain) were obtained from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (NCMA, Bigelow Laboratories, East Boothbay, Maine). Both strains were grown in batch culture using SN media (Waterbury et al. 1986) made with aged, filtered (0.2 \u00b5m), and autoclaved (120\u00b0C, 30 minutes) seawater from station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment). All cultures were incubated at 25\u00b0C on a 12h:12h light cycle at 130 \u00b5mol m-1 s-1 in sterile culture flasks with a vent cap (0.22 \u00b5m hydrophobic membrane). At the late-exponential phase, cultures were transferred in triplicate to 500 mL culture flasks in SN media amended with 1 \u00b5mol L-1 KH2PO4 as the sole phosphorus source; a concentration previously determined as being low enough to induce phosphorus-stress while still maintaining biomass (Cox and Saito, 2013). In the stationary phase, each culture triplicate was transferred to an autoclaved 250 mL polypropylene bottle and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was filtered using a sterile disposable vacuum filtration system (0.2 \u00b5m). Filtrate (70 mL) was added to a pre-rinsed Centricon spin column (Tris Buffer; 20 mmol L-1, pH = 8) and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 45 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The procedure was repeated three times for both strains and triplicates. The sample was then dialyzed twice with Tris buffer (20 mmol L-1, pH = 8), and the concentrate was recovered and brought to a final volume of ~500 \u03bcL using Tris Buffer. Peptide samples were analyzed at the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry (PAMS) facility at the University of Georgia on a Thermo-Fisher LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer coupled with a Proxeon Easy NanoLC system (Waltham, MA, United States) following Adams et al.

Both MS and MS/MS scans were acquired by the Orbitrap mass spectrometer at resolutions of 120 000 and 30 000 respectively, following Diaz et al. (2018). Protein identification was performed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4) with Mascot (Matrix Science). Peptides were mapped to the Synechococcus genome (NCBI BioProject PRJNA230) (Palenik et al. 2003; McCarren et al. 2005). The protein set was searched in BLASTP against NCBI non-redundant databases, and accession numbers were cross-referenced on UniProt to confirm putative function and identify alkaline phosphatases.",

                "projectDescription": "Screening large molecule libraries against pathogenic bacteria is often challenged by a low hit rate due to limited uptake, underrepresentation of antibiotic structural motifs and assays which do not resemble the infection conditions. To address these limitations, we here screen a library focused on alkylguanidinium compounds, a structural motif associated with antibiotic activity and enhanced uptake, under host-mimicking infection conditions against a panel of disease-associated bacteria. Several hit molecules were obtained with activities against Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria highlighting the fidelity of the general concept. Based on the best antibiotic activity, we selected one compound (L15) for in-depth mode of action studies. L15 exhibited bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus USA300 Lac (JE2) with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.5 \u00b5M whereby a structure-activity relationship study with 18 derivatives proved the necessity of the guanidinium motif for antibiotic activity. Electron microscopy studies and depolarization assays at high L15 concentrations showed an impact on the cell membrane and integrity which was absent at the MIC concentration. Sequencing of L15-resistant strains revealed a mutation in an efflux pump but did not provide hints for direct targets. We thus performed affinity-based protein profiling with a L15 probe and identified signal peptidase IB (SpsB) as the most promising hit. Validation by activity assays, binding site identification and molecular docking demonstrated SpsB overactivation by L15, similar to a previously reported activator molecule that dysregulates protein secretion of this essential enzyme. Overall, this study highlights the need for unconventional screening strategies to identify novel antibiotics.",

The HTLV-1 Tax oncoprotein regulates viral gene expression and the NF-kB pathway to promote the survival of HTLV-1 infected T cells. In thsi study, we utilize a kinome-wide shRNA screen to identify the tyrosine kinase KDR/VEGFR2 as an essential survival factor of HTLV-1-transformed T cells. Inhibition of KDR induces apoptosis of Tax expressing HTLV-1-transformed cell lines and CD4+ T cells from HAM/TSP patients. Phosphoproteomics analysis of HTLV-1 transformed cells treated with a KDR inhibitor revealed inhibition of the phosphorylation of multiple receptors/cell surface proteins, ubiquitin conjugating systems, proteases, phosphatases, apoptotic regulatory factors, adhesion/extracellular matrix proteins and viral proteins. This work suggests that HTLV-1 Tax has hijacked KDR kinase activity to promote Tax stability and the proliferation and survival of HTLV-1 infected cells.",

To test the specificity of etomoxir, we generated click chemistry enabled reagents to label etomoxir binding proteins in situ. Etomoxir bound to Cpt1, but also bound to a large array of diverse proteins that metabolize and transport fatty acids in the cytoplasm, peroxisome and mitochondria. Many of the most abundant proteins identified in primary hepatocytes were peroxisomal. The loss of Pex5, required for the import of peroxisomal matrix proteins, eliminated many of these proteins. By utilizing the promiscuous, covalent and fatty acid mimetic properties of etomoxir, novel etomoxir targets of fatty acid w-oxidation were revealed following the loss of Pex5. These data demonstrate that etomoxir is not specific for Cpt1 and is not appropriate as a tool to distinguish the biological effects of fatty acid oxidation.",

                "projectDescription": "This project aims at characterizing the molecular basis of virulence difference between two strains of the Hymenopteran parasitoid Cotesia typhae, which differ in their parasitism success on one host population.  More specifically, we analyzed the protein content of the venom of both strains in order to quantify abundance differences in key virulence proteins.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Venom was extracted from venom gland and reservoir (venom apparatus) of two to three-day-old female C. typhae from both strains. 5 replicates of 15 venom apparatuses per strain were sampled. Females were anesthetized on ice and their abdomen was torn open with dissection forceps in a drop of sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS) 1X. Venom apparatuses were then isolated and gathered in 15 \u00b5L of sterile PBS 1X, before being dilacerated with a needle and the tip of a forceps. Venom preparation was centrifugated at 12,000 G, 4\u00b0C for 4 minutes and only supernatant was collected to discard cellular residues. All 12 samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until further analysis.   The ten samples were used for LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis. Briefly, samples were solubilized in Laemmli buffer (2 % SDS, 10 % Glycerol, 5% betamercaptoethanol, 0.002 % bromophenol blue, 62.5mM Tris-HCL pH 6.8) and 10 \u00b5L of each sample (corresponding to 10-females equivalent) were deposited on electrophoresis gel. After short migrations, bands were cut and separated into two fractions depending on molecular weight (light and heavy). Proteins were reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin in gel as described in (Recorbet et al., 2021). Samples were analyzed on a TimsTof Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker, Billerika USA) coupled to a nanoElute chromatography (Bruker). They were then loaded on a nanoEase trap column and eluted on an aurora column.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Identification was performed using X!Tandem software (Craig et al., 2004; version 2015.04.01.1) against the Cotesia typhae database from NCBI (txid 2053667 , 8423 entries), a custom contaminant database (keratins, trypsin, ...) and the newly annotated database (18667 entries). Protein inference was performed using i2masschroq software (Langella et al., 2017; version 0.4.76). A protein was validated if it was identified by at least two distinct peptides with an e-value smaller than 0.01 and a resulting e-value for the protein smaller than 0.00001 using all samples together. Using in silico generated decoy database, FDR was estimated to 0.23 % for peptide spectrum match and 0.36 % for protein identification. Extracted Ion Current quantification was performed using masschroq (Valot et al., 2011; version 2.4.20,). Mass precision was set to 20 ppm and quantification was performed on 80 % of the theoretical natural isotopic profile. inference can be load by usign xpip fiels with i2masschroq software(http://pappso.inrae.fr/bioinfo/i2masschroq/).

The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is the main regulator of intracellular proteolysis in eukaryotes and is required for parasite's  to life cycle and infection. E3 ubiquitin ligases play important role in UPS and Cullin-1-RING ligases (CRL1) are the largest and most researched family of E3 in eukaryotes. CRL1 complex is made up of SKP1, Cullin1, RBX1, and F-box proteins. This complex is poorly studied in Leishmania. We investigated the interactome of CRL1 complex in L. infantum combining in vitro and in cellulo experiments to identify the interactome of Cullin1 and SKP1 through affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry analysis.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Utilizing axenic promastigote cultures of L. infantum, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 technology for gene tagging. Three independent replicates of L. infantum 3x myc-mCherry::SKP1 or 3x myc-mCherry::CUL1 were employed, alongside two independent repliclates of L. infantum Cas9 T7 as a negative control. Lysates from 4 x 10^9 parasites underwent immunoprecipitation after two washes in PBS and lysis with cold NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Following centrifugation, supernatants were quantified using Bradford assay. Immunoprecipitation utilized 20 mg of total protein incubated with anti-myc beads, followed by stringent washes and on-bead digestion. Trypsin digestion, desalting, and drying preceded analysis via ETD-enabled Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometry coupled to the EASY-nLC system via a Proxeon nanoelectrospray ion source. Peptide separation occurred on a PicoFrit Column (20 cm x ID75 \u03bcm, 5 \u03bcm particle size, New Objective), with an acetonitrile gradient (2\u201390%) in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over 65 minutes. Instrument settings were configured for data-dependent acquisition, with fullscan MS spectra acquired in the Orbitrap analyzer. The resolution was set at r = 60,000, and the 20 most intense peptide ions (charge states \u22652) were selected for fragmentation in the linear ion trap using low-energy CID. Dynamic exclusion parameters were activated to enhance data acquisition efficiency.",

Parameters encompassed a maximum of 2 trypsin missed cleavages, with tolerance levels set at 10 ppm for precursor mass and 1 Da for fragment ions. Filtering criteria maintained a 1% false discovery rate at both peptide and protein levels. Proteins identified in negative controls were excluded from interactome analysis.

Lyophilized proteins were dissolved in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.8 at concentrations varying from 0.1 \u2013 1.5 mg/mL. The dissolved proteins were mixed in pairs of two proteins according to a defined mixing scheme and incubated for 20 min at 50 \u00b0C to induce interactions in vitro. 0.2 \u2013 1 mM cross-linking reagent was added to the groups and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 for 30 min at room temperature. Consequently, all groups were merged, and 8 M Urea was added to the solution. The protein mixture was reduced with 5 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, alkylated in the dark with 40 mM CAA for 30 min at room temperature and digested with 1:200 (wt/wt) Lys-C for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C, shaking.

                "title": "Comparison of the proteome of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) from tdTom-Plin2 heterozygous and wildtype control mice.  These data are presented in the manuscript entitled \u201cA fluorescent perilipin 2 knock-in mouse model reveals a high abundance of lipid droplets in the developing and adult brain\u201d by Madsen et al. 2024.",
                "projectDescription": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic lipid storage organelles. They are tightly linked to metabolism and can exert protective functions, making them important players in health and disease. Most LD studies in vivo rely on staining methods, providing only a snapshot. We therefore developed a LD-reporter mouse by endogenously labelling the LD coat protein perilipin 2 (PLIN2) with tdTomato, enabling staining-free fluorescent LD visualisation in living and fixed tissues and cells. We validate this model under standard and high-fat diet conditions and demonstrate that LDs are highly abundant in various cell types in the healthy brain, including neurons, astrocytes, ependymal cells, neural stem/progenitor cells and microglia. Furthermore, we also show that LDs are abundant during brain development and can be visualized using live-imaging of embryonic slices. Taken together, our tdTom-Plin2 mouse serves as a novel tool to study LDs and their dynamics under both physiological and diseased conditions in all tissues expressing Plin2.  The proteomic comparison in neural stem/progenitor cells served as a further validation that the fluorescent tag does not alter the LD machinery.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Adult mouse NSPCs from the SVZ of three 8-week-old female tdTom-Plin2 het and wt littermates were isolated using papain-based MACS Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Milteny) and the GentleMacs Dissociator (Milteny) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, mice were shortly anaesthetized with isoflurane, followed by decapitation. SVZ were micro-dissected, and a single cell suspension was generated using the papain-based MACS Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Milteny), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The single cell suspension was followed by myelin removal using the MACs myelin removal beads (Milteny,) and a QuadroMACS Separator (Milteny) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The obtained cells were cultured as neurospheres in DMEM/F12/GlutaMAX (Gibco) with B27 (Gibco), 20 ng/ml human EGF (PeproTech), 20 ng/ml human basic FGF-2 (PeproTech), and 1x PSF (Gibco). Medium was changed every 2-3 days. The neurospheres were expanded for 5 passages to remove progenitors and other proliferating cells. After 5 passages, cells were changed to the following culture medium: DMEM/F12/GlutaMAX (Gibco), N2 (Gibco), 20 ng/ml human EGF (PeproTech), 20 ng/ml human basic FGF-2 (PeproTech), 5mg/ml Heparin (Sigma) and 1x PSF (Gibco). All the in vitro experiments were done on pooled NSPCs from 3 mice, passage 7-15. For the proteomic analysis, cell pellets of 4 consecutive passages were collected, washed 2x with PBS and snap frozen on dry ice. Samples were digested following a modified version of the iST method (named miST method). Washed cell pellets were lysed in 300ul miST lysis buffer (1% Sodium deoxycholate, 100mM Tris pH 8.6, 10 mM DTT), heated for 10min at 75C and disrupted by tip sonication (2x15s). Samples were heated 5 min at 95\u00b0C, diluted 1:1 (v:v) with water containing 4mM MgCl2 and benzonase (Merck #70746, 100x dil of stock = 250 Units/ul), and incubated for 15 minutes at RT to digest nucleic acids. Based on tryptophane fluorescence quantification , 50 ug of proteins at 1 ug/ul, were used for digestion. Reduced disulfides were alkylated by adding \u00bc vol. of 160 mM chloroacetamide (32 mM final) and incubating for 45min at RT in the dark. Samples were adjusted to 3 mM EDTA and digested with 0.5 ug Trypsin/LysC mix (Promega #V5073) for 1h at 37\u00b0C, followed by a second 2h digestion with an additional 0.5ug of proteases. To remove sodium deoxycholate, two sample volumes of isopropanol containing 1% TFA were added to the digests, and the samples were desalted on a strong cation exchange (SCX) plate (Oasis MCX; Waters Corp., Milford, MA) by centrifugation. After washing with isopropanol/1%TFA, peptides were eluted in 200ul of 80% MeCN, 19% water, 1% (v/v) ammonia, and dried by centrifugal evaporation. LC-MS/MS analyses were carried out on a TIMS-TOF Pro (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer interfaced through a nanospray ion source (\u201ccaptive spray\u201d) to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC system (Dionex). Peptides (200ng) were separated on a reversed-phase custom packed 45 cm C18 column (75 \u03bcm ID, 100\u00c5, Reprosil Pur 1.9 um particles, Dr. Maisch, Germany) at a flow rate of 0.250 ul/min with a 2-27% acetonitrile gradient in 93 min followed by a ramp to 45% in 15 min and to 90% in 5 min (total method time: 140 min, all solvents contained 0.1% formic acid). Identical LC gradients were used for DDA and DIA measurements. For creation of the spectral library, data-dependent acquisitions (DDA) were carried out on the 6 bRP fractions sample pool using a standard TIMS PASEF method  with ion accumulation for 100 ms for each survey MS1 scan and the TIMS-coupled MS2 scans. Duty cycle was kept at 100%. Up to 10 precursors were targeted per TIMS scan. Precursor isolation was done with a 2 Th or 3 Th windows below or above m/z 800, respectively. The minimum threshold intensity for precursor selection was 2500. If the inclusion list allowed it, precursors were targeted more than one time to reach a minimum target total intensity of 20\u2019000. Collision energy was ramped linearly based uniquely on the 1/k0 values from 20 (at 1/k0=0.6) to 59 eV (at 1/k0=1.6). Total duration of a scan cycle including one survey and 10 MS2 TIMS scans was 1.16 s. Precursors could be targeted again in subsequent cycles if their signal increased by a factor 4.0 or more.  After selection in one cycle, precursors were excluded from further selection for 60s. Mass resolution in all MS measurements was approximately 35\u2019000.  The data-independent acquisition (DIA) used mostly the same instrument parameters as the DDA method. Per cycle, the mass range 400-1200 m/z was covered by a total of 32 windows, each 25 Th wide and a 1/k0 range of 0.3. Collision energy and resolution settings were the same as in the DDA method. Two windows were acquired per TIMS scan (100ms) so that the total cycle time was 1.7 s.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Raw Bruker MS data were processed directly with Spectronaut 18.1.230626.50606 (Biognosys, Schlieren, Switzerland). A library was constructed from the DDA bRP fraction data by searching the reference annotated mouse proteome database of July 1st, 2022 (uniprot_sprot_2022-01-07_MOUSE.fasta, www.uniprot.org). For identification, peptides of 7-52 AA length were considered, cleaved with trypsin/P specificity and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (fixed), methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation (variable) were the modifications applied. Mass calibration was dynamic and based on a first database search. The Pulsar engine was used for peptide identification. Protein inference was performed with the IDPicker algorithm. Spectra, peptide and protein identifications were all filtered at 1% FDR against a decoy database. Specific filtering for library construction removed fragments corresponding to less than 3 AA and fragments outside the 300-1800 m/z range. Also, only fragments with a minimum base peak intensity of 5% were kept. Precursors with less than 3 fragments were also eliminated and only the best 6 fragments were kept per precursor. No filtering was done on the basis of charge state and a maximum of 2 missed cleavages was allowed. Shared (non proteotypic) peptides were kept. The resulting library included 154\u2019856 precursors (109\u2019255 proteotypic peptides) mapped to 8\u2019558 protein groups. Peptide-centric analysis of DIA data was done with Spectronaut 18.1 using the library described above. Single hits proteins (defined as matched by one stripped sequence only) were kept in the Spectronaut analysis. Peptide quantitation was based on XIC area, for which a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 (the 3 best) precursors were considered for each peptide, from which the median value was selected. Quantities for protein groups were derived from inter-run peptide ratios based on MaxLFQ algorithm. Global normalization of runs/samples was done based on the median of peptides. The raw output table contained 8\u2019243 protein groups (minimum 1 precursor per group).  All subsequent analyses were done with the Perseus software package (version 1.6.15.0). Contaminant proteins were removed, and quantity values were log2-transformed. After assignment to groups, only proteins quantified in at least 4 samples of one group (8118 protein groups). After missing values imputation (based on normal distribution using Perseus default parameters), t-tests were carried out among all conditions, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing (Q-value threshold <0.05). For differential analysis, proteins with a minimum of 2 peptides detected were kept (7641) and proteins with a twofold change and an adjusted p-value <0.05 were considered significantly altered.",

For this purpose, after processing the protein extracts (see next section), the resulting peptides were analysed by reverse phase-liquid chromatography (RP-LC)-MS/MS (Dynamic Exclusion Mode). Mass spectra were searched by PEAKS Studio XPro search engine (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada).",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Promastigotes of L. donovani of the HU3 strain (WHO code: MHOM/ET/67/HU3) were grown at 26 \u00b0C in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), hemin (10 \u03bcg/mL) and an antibiotic mix (streptomycin 10 \u03bcg/mL and penicillin 105 U/mL). Cultures (50 mL) were started at 5\u00d7105 cells/mL and the parasites harvested in middle logarithmic growth phase (107 promastigotes/mL). A pellet consisting of 5 \u00d7108 promastigotes was suspended in 300 \u00b5l of S-TRAP buffer: 5% SDS, 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) pH 8.5. The sample was sonicated by the UP100H Ultrasonic Processor (Hielscher, Teltow, Germany) applying a total of 20 pulses  (4 cycles of 5 pulses) at 100% amplitude. The tubes were cooled on ice every each cycle. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00baC, and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie blue staining, the protein concentration was estimated to be around 7 mg/mL.  The sample (150 \u00b5g) was digested using the S-TRAP: Rapid Universal MS Sample Prep Columns (PROTIFI, NY, USA) following the supplier\u2019s instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, the protein extracts (adjusted to 50 \u03bcL with S-TRAP buffer) were reduced and alkylated (disulfide bonds from cysteinyl residues were reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 \u00baC, and then thiol groups were alkylated with 10 mM iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature in darkness). Then, 0.1 volume of phosphoric acid was added to a final concentration of 1.1%; this step is essential to completely denature proteins and trap them in the S-Trap column efficiently. At this point, the pH should be \u2264 1. Afterwards, the sample was diluted with 7 volumes of a mixture consisting (in a 1:7 ratio) of S-Trap Binding Buffer and a solution of 90% methanol and 100 mM TEAB. The sample was digested in column with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) with a 1:25 ratio (protease: protein) and incubated 2 hours at 47 \u00baC in a ThermoMixer. The column was eluted by the addition of 80 \u00b5l of elution buffer (80% acetonitrile (CAN), 0.2 % formic acid), and centrifuged for 1 minute at 4,000 g. The process was repeated and the two eluates were pooled and dried down in a speed-vac device. The digested peptides (30 \u03bcg) were desalted by loading them onto OMIX Pipette tips C18 (Agilent Technologies) before the mass spectrometric analysis (see below).",

Trophozoites were detached from the surface of the dishes by adding cold PBS into the dishes and incubating them at 4\u2103 for 10 min. After three-time washing with PBS, the cell pellets were resuspended in 500 \u03bcl of 8 mg/ml dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate; DSP) solution and cross-linked. The mixture was incubated on the rotator (10 rpm) at RT for 30 min. To quench the reaction, 50 \u03bcl of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) was added, and the mixture was further incubated as above for 15 min at RT. After the pellets were treated with DSP, they were washed with PBS twice. The cells were lysed with 1 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 \u00b5M NaCl, containing 1 % Triton X-100, 0.05 mg/ml E-64, and cOmplete\u2122 Mini). After the debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 G at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, the lysates were mixed and incubated with 50 \u03bcl of protein G Sepharose beads at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr. After centrifugation at 800 G for 3 min at 4\u2103, the supernatant was mixed with 50 \u00b5L of anti-HA monoclonal antibody produced in mouse, clone HA-7, purified immunoglobulin conjugated to agarose beads and incubated with inversion at 4\u00b0C for 3.5 hr. The mixture was centrifuged at 800 G for 3 min at 4\u2103 to separate unbound proteins. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. After washing, the beads were resuspended with 180 \u03bcl of lysis buffer containing HA-peptide at the final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml. The mixture was incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight to elute the bound proteins for HA-EhRacM. After centrifugation at 800 G for 3 min at 4\u2103, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by Mass Spectrometry. Protein extracts were rehydrated in 200 uL 10 mM TEAB and disulfide bonds reduced with 10 uL of 50 mM dithiothreitol for 1 hour at 60C. Samples were cooled to RT and pH adjusted to ~7.5, followed by alkylation with 10 uL of 100 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at RT for 15 minutes. Next, 100 ug (2 uL of 50 ug/uL) SP3 paramagnetic beads (GE Healthcare) were added to the samples, followed by 120 uL 100% ethanol. Samples were incubated at RT with shaking for 5 minutes. Following protein binding, beads were washed with 180 uL 80% ethanol three times. Proteins were digested on-bead with trypsin (Pierce) at 37C overnight (1 ug enzyme). Supernatant was removed from the beads and dried, followed by rehydration in 100 uL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid.

                "projectDescription": "Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels to cilia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a role for DLG1, a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of Dlg1 in mouse kidney caused causes ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based proximity labelling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy showed alterations in the ciliary proteome upon loss of DLG1. Specifically, the retromer-associated protein SDCCAG3, IFT20 and polycystin-2 (PC2) were are reduced in cilia of DLG1 deficient cells compared to control cells. This phenotype was is recapitulated in vivo and rescuable by re-expression of wildtype DLG1, but not a Congenital Anomalies of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (CAKUT)-associated DLG1 variant, p.T489R. Finally, biochemical approaches and Alpha Fold modelling suggested that SDCCAG3 and IFT20 form a complex that associates, at least indirectly, with DLG1. Our work identifies a key role for DLG1 in regulating ciliary protein composition and suggests that ciliary dysfunction of the p.T489R DLG1 variant may contribute to CAKUT.",

We conducted a proximity labeling experiments, which involved the WT and Dlg1-/- cilia-BioID2 lines described above, with the WT and Dlg1-/- BioID2 lines as negative controls. The cells were plated in 15 cm dishes and cultured in normal medium containing DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX Supplement (Gibco, Cat #31331-093) supplemented as described above. Once the cells had reached 80% confluency, they were stimulated for ciliogenesis for 24 h with the medium described above. Proximity labeling was induced overnight by supplementing the medium with 10 \u03bcM Biotin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #B4501). The cells were lysed, and samples were prepared for mass spectroscopy according to a previously published BioID2-based proximity labeling protocol (Aslanyan et al 2023). The trypsinized HA pull down and BioID2 proximity labelling samples were analysed on the Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer as described in (Beyer et al., 2021). Next, Label-free quantification (LFQ) was performed, using Maxquant (V.1.6.1.0) (Cox and Mann 2008; Cox et al., 2014; Beyer et al., 2021). In this, protein identification was done using a human or mouse Swissprot database subsets form November 2019 (20,367 protein entries) or August 2019 (17,027 protein entries) respectively. Identified proteins were further analyzed for statistical enrichment. Identified proteins were classified in a three-Tier system. Tier 3 proteins were filtered to be present in at least 66% of the replicates for the sample of interest (excluding control samples). From these, Tier 2 proteins were classified if they were also Significance A (SignA) positive as calculated in R (version 4.0.4) (R Core Team 2021). Significant proteins were identified using a one-sided SignA outlier test with a Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR correction, performed as described in Cox and Mann, SignA \u22640.05 (Cox and Mann 2011).

                "projectDescription": "Age-related microangiopathy, also known as small vessel disease (SVD), causes damage to the liver, brain, kidney and retina. Based on the DNA damage theory of aging, we reasoned that genomic instability may underlie an SVD caused by dominant C-terminal variants in TREX1, the most abundant 3\u2019-5\u2019 DNA exonuclease in mammals. C-terminal TREX1 variants cause an adult-onset SVD known as retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukoencephalopathy (RVCL or RVCL-S). In RVCL, an aberrant, C-terminally truncated TREX1 mislocalizes to the nucleus due to deletion of its ER-anchoring domain. Since RVCL pathology mimics that of the radiation injury, we reasoned that nuclear TREX1 promotes DNA damage. Here, we show that RVCL-associated TREX1 variants cause DNA damage in humans, mice, and Drosophila, and that cells expressing RVCL mutant TREX1 are more vulnerable to DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and cytokines that up-regulate TREX1, leading to depletion of TREX1-high cells in RVCL mice. RVCL-associated TREX1 mutants inhibit homology-directed repair (HDR), causing DNA deletions and vulnerablility to PARP inhibitors. In women with RVCL, we observe early-onset breast cancer, similar to patients with BRCA1/2 variants. Our results provide a new mechanistic basis linking aberrant TREX1 activity to the DNA damage theory of aging, premature senescence, and microvascular disease.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "For the identification of cellular interacting proteins of WT TREX1 and TREX1 V235Gfs, large-scale FLAG pulldown was performed by transfecting 12 x 10cm dishes of HEK 293T cells with 24 \u00b5g of DNA per dish. Cells were transfected with either WT TREX1 or TREX1 V235Gfs cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 (-) vector containing an N-terminal 3x-FLAG tag using NheI and HindIII restriction sites. Empty vector-transfected cells were included as a control. Cells were harvested and lysed in ice cold Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40, 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail, 1:100 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). Whole cell lysates (WCLs) were initially cleared by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, then further pre-cleared using Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. Precipitates were then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 agarose beads at 4\u00b0C for 4 h, extensively washed with 1% NP-40 lysis buffer, and separated on a NuPAGE 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gradient gel. The protein gel was silver stained according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Invitrogen SilverQuest Silver Staining Kit, and the bands specific to WT TREX1 and TREX1 V235Gfs were excised and analyzed by ion-trap mass spectrometry at the Harvard Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility in Boston, MA. Excised gel bands were cut into approximately 1 mm3 pieces.  Gel pieces were then subjected to a modified in-gel trypsin digestion procedure.  Gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 min. followed by removal of acetonitrile.  Pieces were then completely dried in a speed-vac.  Rehydration of the gel pieces was with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng/\u00b5l modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega) at 4\u00baC.  After 45 min., the excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution to just cover the gel pieces.  Samples were then placed in a 37\u00baC room overnight.  Peptides were later extracted by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by one wash with a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 1% formic acid.  The extracts were then dried in a speed-vac (~1 hr).  The samples were then stored at 4\u00baC until analysis. On the day of analysis the samples were reconstituted in 5 - 10 \u00b5l of HPLC solvent A (2.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid).  A nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 2.6 \u00b5m C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (100 \u00b5m inner diameter x ~30 cm length) with a flame-drawn tip.  After equilibrating the column each sample was loaded via a Famos auto sampler (LC Packings) onto the column. A gradient was formed and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of solvent B (97.5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). As peptides eluted they were subjected to electrospray ionization and then entered into a Velos Orbitrap Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",

                "title": "Comparative exo-proteomic analysis of Trichoderma antagonists induced by oomycete mycelium highlights diverse antagonism strategies",
                "projectDescription": "Plant-beneficial fungi from the genus Trichoderma (Hypocreales, Ascomycota) can control oomyceteous plant-pathogenic Pythium myriotylum (Peronosporales, Oomycota) and thus serve as bioeffectors for the eco-friendly products of crop protection. However, the underlying mechanisms of microbe-microbe interactions have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we focused on the role of the Trichoderma secretome induced by P. myriotylum mycelia. For this purpose, we selected strains showing strong (T. asperellum, T. atroviride, T. virens), moderate (T. cf. guizhouense, T. reesei), and weak (T. parepimyces) activities, respectively, and cultured with the sterilized P. myriotylum mycelia. Secreted proteins were analyzed using label-free LC-MS/MS, bioinformatic localization prediction, gene ontology (GO) annotation, and ortholog analysis. The exoproteomic analysis quantified proteins in the six Trichoderma spp., suggesting unequal antagonistic mechanisms among the strong and weak strains, respectively, with different proportions of putative cellulases, proteases, redox enzymes, and extracellular proteins of unknown function. Notably, proteolysis-related proteins were abundant, while the abundant proteases tended not to be conserved across the species (i.e., non-orthologous). Putative cellobiohydrolases were detected abundantly in all Trichoderma species except for the weak antagonist T. parepimyces, even though its genome encodes for these proteins. Notably, secretomes of the most potent anti-Pythium bioeffectors tended to have higher endo-cellulase activity. Cellulose and other glucans are major components of the oomycete cell wall, which was partly reflected in the cellulases produced by the Trichoderma species. The varying abundances of orthologous proteins suggested the evolution of differing transcription regulation mechanisms across the Trichoderma genus in response to the ubiquitous presence of Oomycota.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "P. myriotylum SWQ7 mycelium was harvested from at least three shaking liquid cultures after 3 d in cV8 medium, pooled, and rinsed with the autoclaved minimal medium that contained (NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084 5 g/L, KH2PO4 15 g/L, MgSO\u2084 0.6 g/L, CaCl\u2082 602.2 mg/L, EDTA 20 mg/L, ZnSO4\u00b77H2O 8.8 mg/L, MnCl2\u00b74H2O 2.02 mg/L, FeSO4\u00b77H2O 2 mg/L, CoCl2\u00b76H2O 0.64 mg/L, CuSO4\u00b75H2O 0.63 mg/L, (NH4)6Mo7O24\u00b74H2O 0.44 mg/L, and was adjusted to pH 5.5 by KH2PO4 or K2HPO4. The rinsed mycelium was freeze-dried, and ground with a ball mill to a fine powder (diameter < 30 \u03bcm). Freshly harvested mature spores from selected Trichoderma strains (1x104 spores/mL) were used to inoculate pre-cultures in 50 mL minimal medium containing 1% w/v D-fructose and 0.1% w/v peptone in a 250 mL flask. The pre-cultures were incubated at 200 RPM and 28\u2103 in the dark for 48 h except for T. parepimyces, which was incubated for 96 h pre-culture. The mycelia were filtered through a nylon net and were rinsed with a minimal medium. One gram wet weight of mycelia (corresponding to ~ 0.06 g dry weight) was inoculated into 50 mL sterilized minimal medium containing 0.4% w/v P. myriotylum mycelial powder as the inducer in a 250 mL flask, and was incubated at 28\u2103, and 200 RPM for 48 h (n = 3). For further investigation of the inductive enzymes from Trichoderma, the supernatant was harvested from liquid cultures at 48 h by centrifugation at 4\u2103 and 7200 x g for 10 mins and was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Later 36 mL of the supernatant from each inductive culture was precipitated by 20% v/v TCA and centrifugation at 4\u2103 and 7200 x g for 10 mins. Then the pellet was extracted with 1 mL of cold acetone twice with centrifugation at 4\u2103 and 20,000 x g for 10 mins and finally resuspended in 100 \u00b5L of 8 M urea. For further exo-proteomic analysis, urea re-solubilized exo-proteins samples were analyzed by the Applied Protein Technology (APT) Company (China) using label-free LC-MS/MS. The samples were digested by trypsin and separated using an Easy nLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 120 mins, and identified using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer. The peptides were loaded onto a reverse phase trap column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100, 100 \u03bcm x 2 cm, nanoViper C18) connected to the C18-reversed-phase analytical column (Thermo Scientific Easy Column, 10 cm long, 75 \u03bcm inner diameter, 3 \u03bcm resin) in 0.1% formic acid and separated with a linear gradient of 84% acetonitrile and 0.1% Formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min, controlled by IntelliFlow technology. Data was acquired using a data-dependent top-10 method dynamically choosing the most abundant precursor ions from the survey scan (300\u20131800 m/z) for HCD fragmentation. The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set to 3 x 106, and a maximum inject time was set to 10 ms. Dynamic exclusion duration was set to 40.0 s. Survey scans were acquired at a resolution set at 70,000 at m/z 200 and the resolution for HCD spectra was set at 17,500 at m/z 200, and the isolation width was 2 m/z. The normalized collision energy was 30 eV and the underfill ratio, which specifies the minimum percentage of the target value likely to be reached at maximum fill time, was defined as 0.1%. The instrument was run with peptide recognition mode enabled.",

                "projectDescription": "The Mec1/ATR kinase is crucial for genome stability, yet the mechanism by which it prevents gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) remains unknown. Here we find that in cells with deficient Mec1 signaling, GCRs accumulate due to the deregulation of multiple steps in homologous recombination (HR). Mec1 primarily suppresses GCRs through its role in activating the canonical checkpoint kinase Rad53, which ensures the proper control of DNA end resection. Upon loss of Rad53 signaling and resection control, Mec1 becomes hyperactivated and triggers a salvage pathway in which the Sgs1 helicase is recruited to sites of DNA lesions via the 911-Dpb11 scaffolds and phosphorylated by Mec1 to favor heteroduplex rejection and limit HR-driven GCR accumulation.",

                "projectDescription": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease and still lacks effective disease-modifying treatments. Here, we performed a multiomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex from 51 sporadic ALS patients and 50 control subjects, as well as from four transgenic mouse models of C9orf72-, SOD1-, TDP-43-, and FUS-ALS to characterize early disease mechanisms in ALS. An integrated analysis of transcriptomes, (phospho-)proteomes, and miRNAomes revealed marked sex-specific differences, more pronounced in males. We identified four transcriptome-based sALS-subclusters that are driven by pathways involved in mitochondrial respiration, synaptic function, immune response and transcription. Diffusion pseudo time estimation suggested that these clusters may represent temporal states in disease progression. Individual omics and multifactorial factor analysis revealed the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as a disease-relevant mechanism. Its modulation by trametinib in vitro and in vivo validated MEK2 as an auspicious therapeutic target for a subgroup of ALS patients.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Phosphoproteomics: starting from the protein extracts from the global proteomics experiments, proteases inhibitors (Sigma, P8340) and phosphatases inhibitors (final concentration in Na3VO4 = 1 mM) were added to all samples. Protein concentration was determined using RC-DC assay (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 250 \u00b5g of proteins for each sample were reduced and alkylated prior to an in-house optimized single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) protocol. Briefly, beads A (Sera-Mag Speed beads, Fisher Scientific, Germany, 45152105050250) and beads B (Sera-Mag Speed beads, Fisher Scientific, Germany, 65152105050250) were combined (ratio 1:1) and, after 3 washing steps with H2O, were added to the samples (ratio beads:protein of 10:1 for each type of beads, meaning a 20:1 ratio for the combination of beads). After inducing protein binding to the beads with 100% ACN for 18 minutes, the beads/proteins mixtures were washed twice with 80% EtOH and once with 100% ACN before being resuspended in 95 \u00b5L NH4HCO3 prior to overnight on-beads digestion (enzyme:protein ratio of 1:20) at 1 000 rpm at 37\u00b0C using modified porcine trypsin/lys-C (Mass Spec Grade mix, Promega, Madison, USA). Digestion was stopped using TFA (final pH < 2). Recovered peptides were resuspended in 170 \u00b5L of 80% ACN, 0.1% TFA and phosphomix I light (Sigma Aldrich) was added to each sample (ratio peptide (\u00b5g)/mix(fmol) = 1.6). Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed on 5 \u00b5L phase Fe(III)-NTA cartridges on an AssayMAP Bravo platform following an IMAC protocol. After the enrichment, FA was added to each sample as well as phosphomix I heavy (Sigma Aldrich) (ratio peptide (\u00b5g)/mix(fmol) = 1.6). Dried phosphopeptides were resuspended in 40 \u00b5L H2O, 2% ACN, 0.1% FA. Sample preparation steps for C9 & FUS mouse models were identical to those previously described for SOD1 & TDP-43, except that proteins were extracted from new tissue samples just before the ph-proteomics experiment. Nano-LC-MS/MS analyses were performed on a nanoAcquity UPLC devise (Waters) coupled to a Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Nanospray Flex\u2122 ion source. Phosphopeptides were separated at 400 nL/min with 105 min gradient of ACN. The system was operated in DDA mode and the ten most abundant ions were selected on each MS spectrum for further isolation and HCD, excluding monocharged and unassigned ions.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "For phosphoproteomics: raw ph-proteomics data were processed using MaxQuant software (version 2.3.1.0). Peaks were assigned with the Andromeda search engine with trypsin/P specificity against an in-house generated protein sequence database containing all mouse entries extracted from UniProtKB-SwissProt (29th of September 2020, 17 061 entries). The minimal peptide length required was seven amino acids and a maximum of one missed cleavage was allowed. Methionine oxidation, acetylation of proteins\u2019 N-termini and serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation were set as variable modifications and Cysteine carbamidomethylation as a fixed modification. For protein quantification, the \u201cmatch between runs'' option was enabled. The maximum false discovery rate was set to 1% at peptide and protein levels with the use of a decoy strategy. Intensities were extracted from the Phospho(STY).txt file and processed through Perseus software (version 2.0.7.0) in which contaminants and reversed proteins, as well as proteins with a negative score were removed. Using the \u201cexpand sites table\u201d option, the intensities of the different phosphopeptides involved in one phosphosite were summed and phosphosites with a localization probability below 75% were removed. The Perseus output table was then used for further statistical analysis. Only phosphosites that were detected in more than 50% of the mice samples of any combination of sex and condition were kept for each dataset. Intensities were log2-transformed, quantile normalization was applied and missing values were imputed by lowest quartile.",

                "projectDescription": "Post-transcriptional regulation of immune-related transcripts by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) impacts immune cell responses, including mast cell functionality. Despite their importance in immune regulation, the functional role of most RBPs remains to be understood. By manipulating the expression of specific RBPs in murine mast cells, coupled with mass spectrometry and transcriptomic analyses, we found that the Regnase family of proteins acts as a potent regulator of mast cell physiology. Specifically, Regnase-1 is required to maintain basic cell proliferation and survival, while both Regnase-1 and -3 cooperatively regulate the expression of inflammatory transcripts upon activation, with Tnf being a primary target in both human and mouse cells. Further, Regnase-3 directly interacts with Regnase-1 in mast cells and is necessary to restrain Regnase-1 expression through the destabilization of its transcript. Overall, our study identifies protein interactors of endogenously expressed Regnase factors, characterizes the regulatory interplay between Regnase family members in mast cells, and establishes their role in the control of mast cell homeostasis and inflammatory responses.",

Digestion was carried out in 8M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C with 1 \u00b5g of Lys-C (FUJIFILM Wako Chemicals), after which the digestion buffer was diluted to final 2M urea with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. 1 \u00b5g of trypsin (Promega) was added for overnight digestion at 37\u00b0C. All steps were performed in agitation to avoid beads precipitation. Digestion was stopped by adding acetonitrile to 2% and trifluoroacetic acid to 0.3% and the beads were collected with DynaMag-2 Magnet (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Digested peptides were purified by loading the supernatant into C18 StageTips (Rappsilber et al., 2007), and eluted with 80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid. Finally, the elution buffer was evaporated by vacuum centrifugation and purified peptides were resolved in 2% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for single-shot LC-MS/MS measurements.",

Data analysis was performed using the Perseus software v.1.6.2.3 (Tyanova et al., 2016). Data were pre-processed by removing proteins only identified by site, reverse hits, and potential contaminants. After log2 transformation of LFQ intensities, biological replicates of each experimental condition were grouped and proteins were filtered for a minimum of 3 valid values in at least one group. Missing data points were then replaced by imputation from a normal distribution with 0.3 width and 1.8 downshift, and a two-sided two-samples t-test (0.05 FDR, 250 randomizations) was used to identify significant changes of protein intensity between each immunoprecipitation experiment and its corresponding isotype control.",

                "projectDescription": "Mammalian cardiac troponin I (cTnI) contains a highly conserved N-terminal extension harboring protein kinase A targets (Ser23/24) which are phosphorylated during \u00df-adrenergic stimulation to increase cardiomyocyte relaxation rate. Here, we show that the Ser23/24 encoding exon 3 of TNNI3 was pseudoexonized multiple times in shrews and moles to mimic Ser23/24 phosphorylation without adrenergic stimulation, thereby facilitating the evolution of exceptionally high resting heart rates (~1000 beats min-1). We further reveal alternative splicing of TNNI3 exon 3 in distantly related bat families with both cTnI isoforms being incorporated into cardiac myofibrils.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "The stained gel bands are washed three times with ddH2O, followed by the addition of 150\u03bcL of destaining solution to remove the stain. After four rounds of water washing, the gel bands are washed twice with 300\u03bcL each of 25mM ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile, and 100% acetonitrile, respectively, until the gel dehydrates and turns white. Then, 50\u03bcL of 10mM DTT solution is added and the gel is reduced in a 56\u2103 water bath for 30 minutes. Once the temperature drops to room temperature, an equal volume of 50 mM IAMAC solution is added and the gel is alkylated in the dark for 15 minutes. The gel bands are then washed twice again with 300\u03bcL each of 25mM ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile, and 100% acetonitrile, and dehydrated until the gel turns white. Next, 15 to 40\u03bcL of proteomics-grade trypsin at a concentration of 0.01 ug/ul is added. After the gel has fully rehydrated and become transparent on ice, 30 to 40\u03bcL of a 50 mM NH4HCO3 solution containing 10% ACN is added to cover the gel. The gel is then digested overnight at 37\u2103 in a water bath. After enzymatic digestion, the supernatant is transferred to a new EP tube. To the remaining gel piece, 100 \u00b5L of extraction solution (67% acetonitrile with 2% formic acid) is added, incubated at 37\u2103 for 30 minutes, followed by sonication for 15 minutes, centrifugation, and the supernatants are combined and concentrated by drying, ready for mass spectrometry analysis.",

                "projectDescription": "It is widely acknowledged that gasdermin family proteins, which are known as the executors of pyroptosis, undergo protease-mediated cleavage prior to inducing pyroptosis. Here, we unexpectedly discovered a non-canonical form of pyroptosis mediated by full-length GSDME (FL-GSDME) without any proteolytic cleavage. Upon intense ultraviolet (UV) irradiation-triggered DNA damage, hyperactivation of nuclear PARP1 led to extensive formation of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymers and then release to the cytoplasm.These PAR polymers activate PARP5 to catalyze GSDME PARylation, resulted in a conformational change in GSDME that relieved autoinhibition imposed by its C terminus on the N terminus. On the other hand, intense UV irradiation boosted mitochondrial fission-dependent generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mito-ROS), further promoting cytochrome c-catalyzed peroxidation of cardiolipin. This lipid-ROS signal was then sensed by PARylated-GSDME and then induced oxidative oligomerization of GSDME, which facilitated FL-GSDME plasma membrane targeting for perforation, eventually inducing pyroptosis. Reagents that concurrently stimulate PARPs activity and lipid-ROS also induced sequential modifications i.e., PARylation and oxidation of FL-GSDME and synergistically promoted pyroptotic cell death. Overall, our findings elucidate a novel mechanism underlying cleavage-independent function of GSDME in executing cell demise, further enriching the paradigms and cognition of FL-GSDME-mediated non-canonical pyroptosis.",

                "projectDescription": "Metacaspases are cysteine proteases present in plants, fungi and protists. While the association of metacaspases with cell death is studied in a range of organisms, their native substrates are largely unknown. Here, we explored the in vivo proteolytic landscape of the two metacaspases, CrMCA-I and CrMCA-II, present in the green freshwater alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, using N-terminal peptide labelling and enrichment during standard conditions and salt stress. Comparison between the cleavage events of CrMCA-I and CrMCA-II in metacaspase mutants revealed unique cleavage preferences and substrate specificity. Degradome analysis demonstrated relevance of the predicted metacaspase substrates to the physiology of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells and its adaptation during salt stress. Functional enrichment analysis indicated an involvement of CrMCA-I in photosynthesis and translation, while CrMCA-II seems to be important during the catabolism of carboxylic acids. Altogether, our findings suggest distinct cellular functions of the two metacaspases in C. reinhardtii during salt stress response.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Four experimental groups were prepared: WT vs. mcaI and WT vs. mcaII grown in control conditions and WT vs. mcaI and WT vs. mcaII grown in salt stress. For every WT and mutant sample, treated and untreated, three biological replicates were pooled. 50 mL of liquid culture (containing 0.8 - 1x108 mL-1 cells) of WT and mutant strains, were harvested by centrifugation at 1610 x g for 3 min. The biomass was frozen in liquid nitrogen and broken down into a fine powder with mortar and pestle. The material was dissolved in 0.5 ml ice-cold lysis buffer composed of Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.4% NP-40 (w/v) in water, a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche, cat. no. 11697498001), 2 mM DTT, and 0.4% Amphipol A8-35 (w/v) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cell lysis was further promoted with 3 cycles of freeze-thawing and 4-fold dilution with 25mM Hepes pH7.5, 25mM NaCl) and 3 rounds of point sonication, followed by centrifugation at 16,000g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Proteins were denatured and S-alkylated followed by Amphipol precipitation. The supernatans were discarded and pellets were resuspended in Tri-ethyl Ammonium bicarbonate buffer. All \u03b1- and \u025b-amines (protein N-terminus and lysine residues) were butylated with an N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of light 12C4-butyrate (WT) or heavy 13C4-butyrate (leg -/-). After Amphipol precipitation and resuspension in TEAB buffer, WT and knock-out mutants were mixed 1:1  followed by trypsin digestion (cleaving only after arginine residues since lysine residues are blocked). Then, in the resulting 4 samples, N-terminally blocked peptides were enriched by Strong Cation Exchange (SCX) at pH3, as such peptides will not bind to the SCX resin at low pH. N-terminal glutamine is able to form a cyclic ring which results in a peptide with a net charge of zero (at the pH used), similar to the blocked N-terminal peptides. To prevent this, pyroglutamate removal was performed prior to the actual SCX step. Finally, to reduce sample complexity resulting from incomplete oxidations on methionine residues during sample handling, all methionine residues were oxidized with hydrogen peroxide followed by peptide purification using Omix purification tips (C18 reversed phase).  Finally, 5 \u00b5l of this solution was injected for LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS/MS was performed on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano liquid chromatography system (Thermo) in line connected to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo, Germany). Trapping was performed at 10 \u03bcl min-1 for 4 min in loading solvent A on a 20 mm trapping column (made in-house, 100 \u03bcm internal diameter (I.D.), 5 \u03bcm beads, C18 Reprosil-HD, Dr. Maisch, Germany). The peptides were separated on a nanoEase column (MZ HSS T3 1.8 \u03bcm, 75 \u03bcm x 250 mm, Waters, part: 186008818)) kept at a constant temperature of 50\u00b0C. Peptides were eluted by a non-linear gradient reaching 33% MS solvent B (0.1% FA in water/acetonitrile (2:8, v/v)) in 147 min, 55% MS solvent B in 203 min and 99% MS solvent B  in 210 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl min-1, followed by a 10-minutes wash at 99% MS solvent B and re-equilibration with MS solvent A (0.1% FA in water). The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition for the 8 most abundant ion peaks per MS spectrum. Full-scan MS spectra (375-1,500 m/z) were acquired at a resolution of 60,000 in the Orbitrap analyzer after accumulation to a target value of 3,000,000. The 8 most intense ions above a threshold value of 10,000 (minimum AGC of 1,000) were isolated for fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 28%. The C-trap was filled at a target value of 100,000 for maximum 100 ms and the MS/MS spectra (200-2,000 m/z) were acquired at a resolution of 15,000 in the Orbitrap analyzer with a fixed first mass of 145 m/z. Only peptides with charges between +2 and +6 were included for fragmentation and the dynamic exclusion was set to 45 s.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Recorded spectra of all 4 groups were searched separately to identify peptides and proteins using the Mascot algorithm (version 2.8.2, https://www.matrixscience.com/). Spectrum matching was performed against the C. reinhardtii protein sequences in the Swiss-Prot reference proteome (database release version of 2020_06, UP000006906, 18,829 protein entries downloaded from www.uniprot.org). In this search, N-terminal butylation was set as a fixed modification using a quantitation method, where peptides containing light butylation (+0 Da) on \u03b1- and \u025b-amines were configured as light component, while peptides containing heavy butylation (+4 Da) on \u03b1- and \u025b-amines were configured as heavy component. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues and oxidation of methionine residues were set as fixed modifications. In a second parallel search the cyclisation of N-terminal glutamine residues and acetylation of protein N-termini (due to in vivo acetylation) were set as variable modifications to also identify peptides that were not labelled by butylation on their N-terminus. In this search, butylation of lysine residues was set as a fixed modification using a quantitation method, where peptides containing the butylation labels (+0 Da or +4 Da) only on the \u03b1- amines were configured as light or heavy component. Carbamidomethylation on cysteine residues and oxidation of methionine residues were again set as fixed modifications.  From both searches peptide identifications exceeding the Mascot identity threshold score at 99% significance were parsed and stored in the in-house ms_lims database (Helsens et al. 2010). This step includes selecting only for the best scoring match for each spectrum with a positive hit in both the searches. All identified peptides were quantified by the Mascot Distiller quantitation algorithm (version 2.7.1.0, https://www.matrixscience.com/). In parallel, all peptides identified with a butylated N-terminus not starting at position 1 or 2, comprising potential cleavage sites, were additionally quantified by the Skyline software, which reported several quantitation quality measures including the rdotp, idotp and ppm deviation values. In a next step, quantitation outputs from Mascot Distiller and Skyline were integrated automatically using a KNIME workflow to generate a list of potential single (or near single) light labelled neo-N-termini. This list was further manually validated and curated using Skyline to come to a final list of high- and low-quality neo-N-terminal peptides. High-quality peptides are characterized by an intense MS1 signal and complete absence of a heavy isotopic envelope. Low-quality peptides showed a lower MS1 intensity, a remaining heavy isotopic envelope (normalized log2 L/H ratio >2.32) and/or noise peaks at the expected position of the heavy envelope.",

                "projectDescription": "This TMT-ABPP experiment was performed in native 293T proteome treated with a range of concentrations of SP3CHO compounds.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Hek293T cells were grown in DMEM (Corning) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin to near confluent, collected, washed twice with cold PBS and were resuspended with lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1% NP-40) and sequentially homogenized by syringe equipped with 21-gauge needle and probe sonicator (5 min, 3-s on, 5-s off, 50% amp) on ice. Soluble native proteome was collected after centrifugation at 1400 g for 5 minutes and protein concentration was measured by BCA assay.   To profile reactive cysteine, 15 \u00b5L lysate (2 \u00b5g/\u00b5L), containing 30 \u00b5g protein respectively, was loaded into 96-well plate. 5 \u00b5L of compound solution in lysis buffer was added to plate for final concentrations as described in figure legend and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature (r.t.). 5 \u00b5L of DBIA solution in lysis buffer was added to a concentration of 500 \u00b5M and incubated in dark for 1 hour at r.t.. 3 \u00b5L SP3 beads (1:1 mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic type, 50 mg/mL, Cat. #45152105050250 and Cat. #65152105050250,) and 30 \u00b5L ~98% ethanol supplemented with 20 mM DTT was added to plate and incubated for 15 minutes with mild shaking before placing the plate on a magnetic stand and aspiration of the liquid. Beads were washed once with 200 \u00b5L 80% ethanol and resuspended in 25 \u00b5L lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM IAA and incubated in dark for 30 minutes with vigorous shaking. 50 \u00b5L ~98% ethanol supplemented with 20 mM DTT was added to the mixture followed by beads-based clean-up with two additional washes using 80 % ethanol. The remaining beads was added 30 \u00b5L 200 mM EPPS buffer (pH 8.5) containing 0.3 \u00b5g Lys-C. After 3-hour incubation at room temperature, 5 \u00b5L EPPS buffer containing 0.3 \u00b5g trypsin was added and incubated with beads at 37 \u00b0C overnight. To the mixture of digested peptides and beads, 9 \u00b5L acetonitrile and 6 \u00b5L TMT (10 \u00b5g/\u00b5L) reagent were sequentially added, followed by gentle mixing at r.t. for 60 minutes. Reaction was quenched by adding 7 \u00b5L 5% hydroxyl amine and all TMT-labeled samples were combined, dried using a SpeedVac and then desalted using a 100-mg Sep-Pak column.   Desalted TMT-labeled peptides were resuspended in 460 \u00b5L100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and added 80 \u00b5L Pierce\u2122 High Capacity Streptavidin Agarose (Cat. #20359) and incubated at r.t. for 3 hours. Resulting mixture was then loaded on a Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter (hydrophilic PTFE, 0.22 \u00b5m pore size) and centrifugated at 1000 g for 30 seconds. Beads were washed sequentially with 300 \u00b5L 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) with 0.05% NP-40 twice, 350 \u00b5L 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) three times and 400 \u00b5L water once. Peptide were eluted sequentially by 1) elution buffer (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with 20-minutes incubation at r.t., 2) elution buffer with 20-minutes incubation; 3) elution buffer with 10-minutes incubation at 72 \u00b0C. The combined eluent was dried in a SpeedVac and desalted via StageTip prior to LC-FAIMS-MS/MS analysis.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "Enriched cysteines were resuspended in loading buffer (5% ACN and 5% FA), loaded on a 100-\u00b5m capillary column packed with 30 cm of Accucore 150 resin (2.6 \u03bcm, 150\u00c5; Thermo Fisher Scientific), separated using a 180-min method on a Proxeon NanoLC-1200 UPLC system. Cysteine data were collected using a high-resolution MS2 method on an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer coupled with a FAIMS Pro device. Data were collected alternating between a set of three FAIMS compensation voltages (CVs). For the single-shot analysis starting with 10 \u00b5g lysate per TMT channel, only one set of CV values (-60, -45 and -35V) was used. For the double-shot analysis starting with 20 \u00b5g lysate per TMT channel, two sets of CV values (-60, -45 and -35V; -70, -55 and -30) were used. MS1 scans were collected in the Orbitrap with a resolution setting of 60 K, a mass range of 400-1600 m/z, an AGC at 100%, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. MS2 scans were acquired in Top Speed mode with a cycle time of 1 s. Peptide precursors were selected and fragmented using HCD with a collision energy of 36. MS2 scans were collected in the Orbitrap with a resolution of 50K, a fixed scan range of 110-2000 m/z, and a 500% AGC with a maximum injection time of 86 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 120 s with a mass tolerance of \u00b1 10 p.p.m.. The flowthrough were separated using a 60-min method and analyzed by FAIMS-MS/MS using CV set of -80, -60 and -40. Data dependent analysis were performed in same setting as analyzing cysteine samples except a dynamic exclusion time of 90 s. Raw files of cysteine profiling were searched using the open-source Comet search engine (ver. 2019.01.5)1 with the Uniprot human proteome database (downloaded 11/24/2021) with contaminants and reverse decoy sequences appended. Precursor error tolerance was 50 p.p.m. and fragment error tolerance was 0.9 Da. Static modifications include Cys carboxyamidomethylation (+57.0215) and TMTpro18 (+304.2071) on Lys side chains and peptide N-termini. Methionine oxidation (+15.9949) and DBIA-modification on cysteine residues (+239.1628) were allowed as variable modifications.  Peptide spectral matches were filtered to a peptide false discovery rate (FDR) of <1% using linear discriminant analysis employing a target-decoy strategy2,3. Resulting peptides were further filtered to obtain a 1% protein FDR at the entire dataset level (including all plexes in an experiment)4. Cysteine-modified peptides were filtered for site localization using the AScorePro algorithm with a cutoff of 13 (P < 0.05) as previously described5,6. Overlapping peptide sequences generated from different charge states, retention times and tryptic termini were grouped together into a single entry. A single quantitative value was reported, and only unique peptides were reported. Reporter ion intensities were adjusted to correct for impurities during synthesis of different TMT reagents according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. For quantification of each MS3 spectrum, a total sum signal-to-noise of all reporter ions of 180 (TMTPro 18-plex) was required. Peptide quantitative values were normalized so that the sum of the signal for all proteins in each channel was equal to account for sample loading differences (column normalization). 1.

                "projectDescription": "In malaria parasites, the regulation of mRNA translation, storage and degradation during development and life stage transitions remains largely unknown. Here, we functionally characterized the DEAD-box RNA helicase PfDOZI in P. falciparum. Disruption of pfdozi enhanced asexual proliferation but reduced sexual commitment and impaired gametocyte development. By quantitative transcriptomics, we show that PfDOZI is involved in the regulation of invasion-related genes and sexual stage-specific genes during different developmental stages. PfDOZI predominantly participates in processing body-like mRNPs in schizonts but germ cell granule-like mRNPs in gametocytes to impose opposing actions of degradation and protection on different mRNA targets. We further show the formation of stress granule-like mRNPs during nutritional deprivation, highlighting an essential role of PfDOZI-associated mRNPs in stress response. Here, we demonstrate that PfDOZI participates in distinct mRNPs to maintain mRNA homeostasis in response to life-stage transition and environmental changes by differentially executing post-transcriptional regulation on the target mRNAs.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "For the PfDCP2 and PfGBP2 interactomes, normal and stressed schizonts of respective GFP-tagged parasite lines were used for IP. Parasite pellet was lysed with five volumes of pre-cooled lysis buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% v/v glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, and 0.5 mM DTT) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Then, the parasites were mechanically lysed using a homogenizer with 80\u2013100 strokes. The supernatant was incubated with 100 \u03bcl of GFP-Trap beads slurry (ChromoTek) with gentle rotation at 4 oC for 2 h. Meanwhile, an aliquot of the parasite lysate was incubated with the agarose beads (ChromoTek) as the control. Subsequently, the beads were washed with washing buffer (300 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 0.5 mM DTT) three times. Finally, the protein complex was eluted with a buffer (pH 2.8) containing a primary amine and concentrated by Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore).   Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained for visualization. The gel section was minced and de-stained before being reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA), and finally digested with Trypsin/Lys-C overnight at 37 oC. Peptides were extracted using 50/50 acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O/0.1% formic acid and dried in a vacuum concentrator (Labconco). Peptides were resuspended in 98% H2O/2% ACN/0.1% formic acid for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Peptides were separated using a 50 cm C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Thermo) on an Ultimate3000 UHPLC (Thermo) with a 120 min gradient (2\u201332% ACN with 0.1% formic acid) and analyzed on a hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive Plus, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using data-dependent acquisition in which the top 10 most abundant ions were selected for MS/MS analysis.",

                "projectDescription": "Integrin trafficking to and from membrane adhesions is a crucial mechanism that dictates many aspects of a cell\u2019s behaviour, including motility, polarisation, and invasion. In endothelial cells (ECs), the intracellular traffic of \u03b15-integrin is regulated by both neuropilin 1 (NRP1) and neuropilin 2 (NRP2), yet the redundancies in function between these co-receptors remain unclear. Moreover, the endocytic complexes that participate in NRP-directed-traffic remain poorly annotated. Here we identify an important role for the GTPase-activating protein p120RasGAP in ECs, promoting the recycling of \u03b15-integrin from early endosomes. Mechanistically, p120RasGAP enables transit of endocytosed \u03b15-integrin-NRP1-NRP2 complexes to Rab11+ recycling endosomes, promoting cell polarisation and fibronectin (FN) fibrillogenesis. Silencing of both NRP receptors, or p120RasGAP, resulted in the accumulation of \u03b15-integrin in early endosomes, a loss of \u03b15-integrin from surface adhesions, and attenuated EC polarisation. Endothelial-specific deletion of both NRP1 and NRP2 in the postnatal retina recapitulated our in vitro findings, severely impairing FN fibrillogenesis and polarised sprouting. Our data assign an essential role for p120RasGAP during integrin traffic in ECs and support a hypothesis that NRP receptors co-traffic internalised cargoes. Importantly, we utilise comparative proteomics analyses to, for the first time, isolate a comprehensive map of NRP1-dependent and NRP2-dependent-\u03b15-integrin interactions in ECs.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Samples were resolved via 1D SDS-PAGE stained with Quick Coomassie Stain. Each gel lane was run for 12 minutes with the whole area being excised, then subjected to in-gel processing before an overnight digestion with trypsin.  Digested peptides were run on a Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo Scientific) instrument coupled to a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific) with LC buffers composed of buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The buffers were used to create a gradient lasting 185 minutes (see screenshot of gradient profile below) where the peptides were eluted from a 200cm uPAC nanoLC C18 column (Pharma Fluidics) at a flow rate of 300nl/min for the first 156 minutes before increasing to 400nl/min for the remainder of the gradient. Raw data was acquired in Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mode. A scan cycle compromised a full MS scan with an m/z range of 345-1155, resolution of 70,000, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) target 3x106 and a maximum injection time of 200ms. MS scans were followed by DIA scans of dynamic window widths with an overlap of 0.5 Th. DIA spectra were recorded with a first fixed mass of 200m/z, resolution of 17,500, AGC target 3x106 and a maximum IT of 55ms. Normalised collision energy was set to 25 % with a default charge state set at 3. Data for both MS scan and MS/MS DIA scan events were acquired in profile mode.",

                "projectDescription": "14-3-3 proteins have the unique ability to bind and sequester a multitude of diverse phosphorylated signaling proteins and transcription factors. Many previous studies have shown that 14-3-3 interactions with specific phosphorylated substrate proteins can be enhanced through small-molecule natural product or fully synthetic molecular glue interactions. However, enhancing 14-3-3 interactions with both therapeutically intractable transcription factor substrates as well as potential neo-substrates to sequester and inhibit their function has remained elusive. One of the 14-3-3 proteins, 14-3-3\uf073\uf020or SFN, has a cysteine C38 at the substrate binding interface near sites where previous 14-3-3 molecular glues have been found to bind. In this study, we screened a fully synthetic cysteine-reactive covalent ligand library to identify molecular glues that enhance interaction of 14-3-3\uf073\uf020with not only druggable transcription factors such as estrogen receptor (ER\uf061), but also challenging oncogenic transcription factors such as YAP and TAZ that are part of the Hippo transducer pathway. We identified a hit EN171 that covalently targets both C38 and C96 on 14-3-3 to enhance 14-3-3 interactions with ER\uf061\uf02c\uf020YAP, and TAZ leading to impaired estrogen receptor and Hippo pathway transcriptional activity. We further demonstrate that EN171 could not only be used as a molecular glue to enhance native protein interactions, but also could be used as a covalent 14-3-3 recruiter in heterobifunctional molecules to sequester nuclear neo-substrates such as BRD4 and BLC6 into the cytosol. Overall, our study reveals a covalent ligand that acts as a novel 14-3-3 molecular glue for challenging transcription factors such as YAP and TAZ and demonstrates that these glues can be potentially utilized in heterobifunctional molecules to sequester nuclear neo-substrates out of the nucleus and into the cytosol to enable targeted protein localization.",

The pathobiology of FMD involves arterial lesions of stenosis, dissection, tortuosity, dilation and aneurysm which can lead to hypertension, stroke, heart attack and even death. While a limited number of gene variants have been associated with FMD, there are no animal models and few insights as to why this disease occurs. By integrating DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from primary fibroblasts of 83 FMD patients and 71 matched healthy controls from the DEFINE-FMD study, we inferred 18 gene co-expression networks, four of which were found to act together as an FMD-associated supernetwork in the arterial wall. After in vivo perturbation of this gene co-expression supernetwork by selective knockout of a top network key driver, mice developed arterial dilation; a hallmark of FMD. Molecular studies indicated that this supernetwork governs multiple aspects of vascular cell physiology and functionality, including collagen/matrix production. Using linkage disequilibrium score regression to determine the genetic contribution to disease, we found that this supernetwork accounts for a significant proportion of FMD heritability (H squared).

The thoracic and abdominal aortas were then snap frozen into two separate cryovials on dry ice and stored at -80\u00b0C, prior to being processed in a single batch for analysis by mass spectrometry. Thoracic and abdominal aortic tissues from Sm22\u03b1-Ubr4-KO and littermate control mice were homogenized in guanidine HCl buffer (4M GuHCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.8, 25 mM EDTA supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and shaken for 48 hours. 20 \u00b5g of proteins were precipitated overnight using ethanol. After centrifuging at 16,000 g for 30 mins at 4\u00b0C, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dried using a vacuum centrifuge. The pellet was resuspended in deglycosylation buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM Sodium Acetate, 25 mM EDTA, pH 6.8) and the following enzymes were added: endo-\u03b1-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, \u03b21,4-galactosidase, \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase, \u03b12-3,6,8,9-Neuraminidase (all from Merck-Millipore Glycoprotein Deglycosylation Kit, Cat No. 362280), Chondroitinase ABC (Sigma-Aldrich, C3667), Heparinase II (Sigma-Aldrich, H6512) and Endo-\u03b21,4-galactosidase (Sigma-Aldrich, G6920). Samples were incubated for 1 hour at 25\u00b0C, followed by 24 hours at 37\u00b0C in agitation, then dried using a vacuum centrifuge. Subsequently, samples were reconstituted in 18O-labeled water containing N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F, from the Merck-Millipore Glycoprotein Deglycosylation Kit, Cat No. 362280), and incubated at 37\u00b0C with agitation for 24 hours. Proteins were denatured by 6 M urea, 2 M thiourea, reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol, and alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide. Proteins were precipitated with acetone, dried in a vacuum centrifuge, and resuspended in 0.1M triethylammonium bicarbonate. Proteins were digested with Trypsin/LysC and peptides were desalted using C18 resin. Peptides were analysed by an UltiMate 3000 LC system coupled to a Q Exactive HF (all Thermo Scientific) using an 80-minute reversed-phase liquid chromatography gradient. Precursor spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (resolution 60,000 at 200 m/z). Data-dependent fragment spectra of the most abundant precursor ions were obtained after higher-energy collisional dissociation and Orbitrap detection (resolution 15,000).",

Trypsin was set as the protein-digesting enzyme, with up to two allowed missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine (static), 18O deamidation of asparagine (dynamic), and oxidation of lysine, methionine, and proline (dynamic) were selected as modifications. The quality of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) obtained from the Mascot target/decoy search was assessed using Percolator. PSM and peptide validation were conducted with Peptide Validator, maintaining a target false discovery rate of 0.01 for both PSMs and peptides. Quantification was based on precursor intensity.",

                "projectDescription": "To enable successful SLC function deorphanization we aimed to select a minimal number of cell lines covering expression of as many SLCs as possible. Based on a publicly available RNA-Seq dataset of 675 cell lines (Klijn C. et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 2015) we selected a set of 6 adherent human cell lines (HCT 116, Huh 7, LS180, MDA MB 468, SK MEL 28, 1321N1) cumulatively covering expression (TPM>1) of about 80% of all human SLCs. These cell lines will be used to generate SLC-knockout and SLC-overexpressing single cell clones. Additionally, Jump-In T-REx HEK293 cells will be used for generating SLC-overexpression cell lines.  In order to characterize the expressed proteome of these parental cell lines, we performed extensive proteomic profiling using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Mass spectra were acquired on a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Instrument performance was monitored by a quality control routine using BSA- and HeLa digest standards. Data was analyzed using Thermo Proteome Discoverer 2.3 software.  This data release consist of  (1) RAW mass spectrometry data files generated by the instrument per fraction, (2) ProteomeDiscoverer result files containing all Peptide-Spectrum-Matches (PSMs), peptide and protein grouping, scoring and confidence values, as well as abundance values from label-free-quantitation (LFQ).  As RESOLUTE will generate a significant number of protein-protein interaction data sets (AP-MS and BioID), the presented whole proteome profiling data set can serve as a reference core proteome data set, providing I) technical information on detected and expressed tryptic peptides and proteins; and II) provide valuable information on quantitative distribution of i.e. bait and prey proteins in the different cell lines. In conjunction with the other Omics data sets, like the previously published transcriptomics data, the characterization of the proteome will complement and enable valuable insight into the biological state of the investigated cell lines under default culturing conditions. Furthermore, members of the research community might apply advanced analyses with a focus out of the scope of the RESOLUTE project (e.g. PTM analysis).",

STR profiling was performed for all cell lines to confirm identity. Cell were grown in 10 cm dishes until confluence.  2) CELL LYSIS Cells were washed 1x with PBS and then harvested by cell scraping in PBS supplemented with cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche). Cell pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C. After thawing on ice cells pellets, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates were additionally sonicated using a Covaris type sonicator and cleared by centrifugation at 14.000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. Protein concentration of transferred supernatant was measured using BCA protein assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol.  3) PROTEIN DIGESTION & FRACTIONATION For each cell lysate, 250\u03bcg of total protein were digested with trypsin applying a modified FASP protocol published by Wisniewki et at 2009. After digestion, peptides were cleaned up and concentrated using C18 Solid Phase Extraction (SPE, MicroSpin columns, silica C 18, 3\u2013300 \u03bcg capacity; The Nest Group). Eluted and dried peptides were reconstituted in 20mM ammonium formate, pH 10 prior to separation on a Gemini-NX C18 column (Phenomenex, Inc.) into 96 fractions using high pH RP-HPLC on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC. Solvent A consisted of 5% acetonitrile in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10 and solvent B of 90% acetonitrile in 20 mM ammonium formate, pH 10. Flow rate was set to 100 \u03bcL min\u22121 and peptides eluted from the column applying a three step gradient ranging from 0 to 100% solvent B. Collected fractions were acidified and pooled into 36 fractions in a concatenated fashion. After removal of organic solvent, each fraction was reconstituted with 10\u00b5l 5% formic acid.   4) LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS Mass spectrometry was performed on a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an Dionex Ultimate 3000RSLC nano system (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) via nanoflex source interface. Tryptic peptides were loaded onto a trap column (Pepmap 100 5\u03bcm, 5 x 0.3 mm, ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) at a flow rate of 10 \u03bcL/min using 2% ACN and 0.1% TFA as loading buffer.

Mobile-phase A consisted of 0.4% formic acid in water and mobile-phase B of 0.4% formic acid in a mix of 90% acetonitrile and 10% water. The flow rate was set to 230 nL/min and a 90 min gradient used (6 to 30% solvent B within 81 min, 30 to 65% solvent B within 8 min and, 65 to 100% solvent B within 1 min, 100% solvent B for 6 min before equilibrating at 6% solvent B for 18 min). Analysis was performed in a data-dependent acquisition mode.  Full MS scans were acquired with a mass range of 375 - 1650 m/z in the orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000 (at 200Th). Automatic gain control (AGC) was set to a target of 1 \u00d7 106 and a maximum injection time of 55ms. Precursor ions for MS2 analysis were selected using a Top15 dependant scan approach using a quadrupole isolation window of 1.6 Da and higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 38%. AGC target was set to 1 \u00d7 105 with a maximum injection time of 50 ms and an Orbitrap resolution of 17,500 (at 200 Th). Dynamic exclusion for selected ions was 60 s. A single lock mass at m/z 445.120024 was employed.   5) REPLICATION 7 cell lines in 36 fractions each; no biological or technical replicates",

                "projectDescription": "The intestinal anaerobic bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila is specialized in the degradation of mucins, which are heavily O-glycosylated proteins that constitute the major components of the mucus lining the intestine. Despite that adhesion to mucins is considered critical for the persistence of A. muciniphila in the human intestinal tract, our knowledge of how this intestinal symbiont recognizes and binds to mucins is still limited. Here, we first show that the mucin-binding properties of A. muciniphila are independent of environmental oxygen concentrations and not abolished by pasteurization. We then dissected the mucin-binding properties of pasteurized A. muciniphila by use of a recently developed cell-based mucin array that enables display of the tandem repeats of human mucins with distinct O-glycan patterns and structures. We found that A. muciniphila recognizes the unsialylated LacNAc (Gal\u03b21-4GlcNAc\uf0621-R) disaccharide selectively on core2 and core3 O-glycans. This disaccharide epitope is abundantly found on human colonic mucins capped by sialic acids, and we demonstrated that endogenous A. muciniphila neuraminidase activity can uncover the epitope and promote binding. In summary, our study provides insights into the mucin-binding properties important for colonization of a key mucin-foraging bacterium.",

For lysis, T175 flask pellets were resuspended in 600 \u03bcL, P100 pellets in 200 \u03bcL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8; 0.5 % TritonX-100; 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL DNaseI; 2.5 mM MgCl2; 2 mM PMSF;1x Protease inhibitor Mix M (Serva)). The lysate was passed through 20G, 23G and 27G needle gauges multiple times with intermediate vortexing and 10 min incubation steps on ice. Subsequently, the lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 18000 g at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and diluted 1.5-fold with dilution buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8; 2 mM PMSF). For analysis of the input (IN), 20 \u03bcL of the lysate were mixed with an equal amount of 4x SDS-Sample buffer. For IP, 80 \u03bcL slurry of each Nb-trap was equilibrated in IP buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) and added to equal amounts of lysate. As positive (domain mapping) or negative control (precipitation of endogenous Drp1), 80 \u03bcL GFP-Trap slurry (ChromoTek) was used. For IC-IP, 80 \u03bcL of RFP-Trap slurry (ChromoTek) was used. Soluble protein extracts were incubated with the Nb-traps overnight at 4 \u00b0C on an-end-over end rotor. For positive control (precipitation of endogenous Drp1), 4 \u03bcL Drp1-antibody was added to the lysate and after overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C 80 \u03bcL equilibrated Protein A/G sepharose slurry were added followed by additional 3-4 hours incubation at 4 \u00b0C. Beads were harvested by centrifugation (2000 g, 2 min, 4 \u00b0C) and supernatant (non-bound sample) was mixed 1:1 with 4x SDS-sample buffer. The beads were washed 3 times with 500 \u03bcL wash buffer (IP buffer with 2 mM PMSF, for MS samples additionally 1x Protease inhibitor mix and 0.05 % Tween20). With the third wash, beads were transferred into a fresh tube. The beads were boiled in 60 \u03bcL 2x SDS-sample buffer for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C and the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube (bound sample).Drp1 pulldown using the D7 and D63 nanotraps were compared to the GFP-Trap (negative control) in three replicates. Proteins were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE (4-12% NuPAGE tris gel (Invitrogen)) for 7 min at 200 V and stained with Coomassie blue. The protein gel pieces were subjected to tryptic digestion as described previously (Shevchenko et al., 2006). Purified peptide samples were measured on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) online-coupled to an Easy-nLC 1200 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated using a 20-cm-long, 75\u2013\u03bcm\u2013inner diameter analytical HPLC column (ID PicoTip fused silica emitter; New Objective, Berks, UK) packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9-\u03bcm silica beads (Dr Maisch GmbH) and eluted using a 60 min segmented gradient from to 10 - 90% of solvents A (0.1 % formic acid) and B (80 % acetonitrile in 0.1 % formic acid) at a constant flow rate of 200 nl/min. The column temperature was maintained at 40 \u00b0C using an integrated column oven. Peptides were ionized by nanospray ionization and a capillary temperature of 275 \u00b0C. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode. Full MS scans were acquired in a range of 300-1750 m/z at resolution of 60,000. Seven most intense multiple-charged ions were selected for HCD fragmentation with a dynamic exclusion period of 30 s and tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra were acquired at resolution of 15,000.",

(Cox and Mann, 2008) and searched against the Uniprot Homo sapiens database (105.079 entries, downloaded 2022/08/01), Vicugna pacos derived nanotraps and commonly observed protein contaminants. For MS and MS/MS, the peptide mass tolerance was set at 4.5 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. Only two missed cleavages were allowed for the tryptic digestion. Carbamidomethylation (C) was used as fixed modification, while oxidation (M) and acetylation (protein N-term) were defined as variable modifications. False discovery rate was set to 1% at both peptide and protein level. For label-free quantification a minimum ratio count of two was requested. Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) was enabled. Downstream analysis of the \u2018proteinGroups.txt\u2019 output table was performed in Perseus (version 1.6.15.0). Contaminants, reversed proteins and proteins only identified by site were filtered out. Only proteins that were quantified in two out of three replicates of either the bait or control pulldown were retained in the dataset.",

Proteins were precipitated in 1.8:2:2 water:methanol:chloroform, collected by centrifugation, washed twice with methanol, and solubilized in 8M guanidine-HCl, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.6. Reduction and alkylation were performed with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 20 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 1 hr each, respectively. Proteins were digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison WI), at a protein:protease ratio of 30:1 overnight at 37\u00b0C. Peptides were desalted by solid phase extraction using hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridges (Waters, Bedford MA). Samples were labelled with 6-plex TMT (Thermo Scientific). Excess label was quenched with hydroxylamine hydrochloride, following which labelled samples were pooled and desalted using HLB cartridges. TMT labelled samples were fractionated offline by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) prior to LC-MS/MS as described [49]. Peptides were eluted from HILIC in 1 min fractions and adjoining fractions pooled to a final concatenated 6-12 fractions and lyophilized. Peptide fractions were separated by reversed phase chromatography over a 90 min gradient [49] into a Q Exactive Plus or Q Exactive\u2122 HF Hybrid Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

                "projectDescription": "Deep proteomic analysis of mammalian cell lines would yield an inventory of the building blocks of the most commonly used systems in biological research. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can identify and quantify proteins in a global and unbiased manner and can highlight the cellular processes that are altered between such systems. We analyzed 11 human cell lines using an LTQ-Orbitrap family mass spectrometer with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high field\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Orbitrap mass analyzer with improved resolution and sequencing speed. We identified a total of 11,731 proteins, and on average 10,361 \u00c2\u00b1 120 proteins in each cell line. This very high proteome coverage enabled analysis of a broad range of processes and functions. Despite the distinct origins of the cell lines, our quantitative results showed surprisingly high similarity in terms of expressed proteins. Nevertheless, this global similarity of the proteomes did not imply equal expression levels of individual proteins across the 11 cell lines, as we found significant differences in expression levels for an estimated two-third of them. The variability in cellular expression levels was similar for low and high abundance proteins, and even many of the most highly expressed proteins with household roles showed significant differences between cells. Metabolic pathways, which have high redundancy, exhibited variable expression, whereas basic cellular functions such as the basal transcription machinery varied much less. We harness knowledge of these cell line proteomes for the construction of a broad coverage \u00e2\u20ac\u0153super-SILAC\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd quantification standard. Together with the accompanying paper (Schaab, C. MCP 2012, PMID: 22301388) (17) these data can be used to obtain reference expression profiles for proteins of interest both within and across cell line proteomes.",

LnCap and Jurkat cells were cultured with RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Three separate cell pellets from subconfluent cultures were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u00e2\u02c6\u201980 \u00c2\u00b0C. Cells were lysed with a buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m dithiothreitol and 4% SDS, and incubated at 95 \u00c2\u00b0C for 5 min. Lysates were sonicated using a Branson type sonicator and were then clarified by centrifugation at 16,100 \u00c3\u2014 g for 10 min. For SILAC experiments Jurkat, HEK293, LnCap, HeLa, and K562 cells were cultured in medium containing Lys8 and Arg10 instead of the natural amino acids, and supplemented with 10% dialyzed serum. Cells were cultured for about eight doublings in the SILAC medium to reach complete labeling.

MS/MS spectra were searched by the Andromeda search engine (23) against the decoy IPI-human database version 3.68 containing forward and reverse sequences (total of 174,166 entries including forward and reverse sequences). Additionally the database included 248 common contaminants. MaxQuant analysis included an initial search with a precursor mass tolerance of 20 ppm the results of which were used for mass recalibration (24). In the main Andromeda search precursor mass and fragment mass had an initial mass tolerance of 6 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. The search included variable modifications of methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation, and fixed modification of carbamidomethyl cysteine. Minimal peptide length was set to six amino acids and a maximum of two miscleavages was allowed. The false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01 for peptide and protein identifications. In the case of identified peptides that are all shared between two proteins, these are combined and reported as one protein group. For comparison between samples we used label-free quantification with a minimum of two ratio counts to determine the normalized protein intensity (25). For ranking of the absolute abundance of different proteins within a single sample we used the iBAQ algorithm (9). Protein table were filtered to eliminate the identifications from the reverse database, and common contaminants. Peptide and protein tables are given as supplemental Tables S2 and S3.",

Finally Desalt the enzymatic peptides using a Strata X column and dry them under vacuum. 2. High-pH Reversed-Phase (RP) Separation. An equal amount of peptides from each sample was taken to pool into a mixture, and 20\u03bcg of mixture was diluted with 2mL of mobile phase A (5% ACN pH 9.8) for injection. The Shimadzu LC-20AB HPLC system coupled with a Gemini high pH C18 column (5m, 4.6 x 250mm) was used. The sample was subjected to the column and then eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL/min by gradient: 5% mobile phase B (95% ACN, pH 9.8) for 10 minutes, 5% to 35% mobile phase B for 40 minutes, 35% to 95% mobile phase B for 1 minute, flow Phase B lasted 3 minutes and 5% mobile phase B equilibrated for 10 minutes. The elution was collected every 1 minute. Finally, all the fractions were combined into a total of 10 fractions, which were then frozen and dried.",

The method represents a potent protocol for spatial FFPE tissue subsection processing in combination with laser capture microdissection, achieving sufficient MS signal from 50 um size mammary acini FFPE voxels. By eliminating additional robotic platforms, desalting and detergent removal steps  prior to injection to the liquid chromatograph, this method minimizes protein losses and keep the analysis cost effective. In-insert proteomics maintains sufficient sensitivity to preserve spatial context within a single FFPE tissue slide. This project aim was to acquire data-dependent data (DDA) on Exploris 480 to demonstrate the sensitivity of the In-insert protocol sensitivity and benchmark it with intersecting protocol published by Weke et al. (2022).",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Microdissection was performed using a PALM MicroBeam Laser Microdissection system (Zeiss), equipped with UV laser for cutting (355 nm) by a board certified pathologist. The slides were visualized using the PALMRobo 4.6 software (Zeiss) and areas containing mammary gland acini were selected. Prior to microdissecting the tissue of interest, the laser parameters were optimized for each employed objective. The microdissected tissue voxels were collected using the Laser Pressure Catapult (LPC) into tubes with an adhesive cap (AdhesiveCap 500, # 415190-9201-000, Zeiss) and stored on ice before further processing. The adhesive cap was examined under the light microscope at 10x zoom or with magnifying glass to confirm presence of LCM dissected FFPE tissue voxels. Subsequently, the tissue was carefully inspired into a pipette tip with the lysis buffer and transferred into a bottom part of glass insert (0.1 ml Micro-insert, Lab Logistics Group GMBH, cat. no: 7401744) without puncturing the glue. Tissue voxels were mixed with 0.2% DMM, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Tissue was decrosslinked in a wet chamber on thermomixer for 1 h at 95\u00b0C and 600 RPM. Protein alkylation was performed by adding 50 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in LC-MS water to 10 mM final concentration in the reaction mixture. Protease digestion was performed by addition of 27 \u00b5l of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.74 nmol/\u00b5l trypsin in LC-MS water and reaction mixture was homogenized per voxel. The Pierce\u2122 High pH Reversed-Phase Peptide Fractionation Kit was used to fractionate pooled sample (approx. 10 ul of each voxel digest) into 8 fractions according to manufacturer guidelines. Fractions were evaporated in SpeedVac and dissolved in 20 \u00b5l of 0.08 % TFA, 2.5% AcN in LC-MS water prior LC-MS/MS analysis. Peptide digests of voxels were centrifuged at 10000g/30 min/20\u00b0C and directly analyzed by both DIA and DDA acquisition on Exploris 480. Voxels number 2, 5, 8 were dropped from analysis due to suspicion to polymeric contamination introduced during voxel processing. Six microliters of the sample were injected to Thermo Scientific, UltiMate\u2122 3000 RSLCnano System and concentrated on an a C18 precolumn. Injected sample was desalted on the precolumn by a 0.08 % TFA, 2.5% AcN in LC-MS water at constant mobile for 10 min. A linear gradient of mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid (FA) in ACN (v/v)) in a mobile phase A (0.1% FA in water (v/v)) was used to separate peptides on 25 cm C18 PepMap column. Analytical peptide separation was enabled by a linear increasing of B up to 40% B in 90 min (60 and 20 min for gradient length comparison) with a constant flow of 300 nl/min. Exploris 480 acquired data in data dependent and data independent mode. A precursor range was set from m/z 350 Th to m/z 1200 Th. Normalized AGC target was set to 300% with auto setting on maximum injection time. Each MS scan was followed by a fragmentation of the top 15 most intense precursor ions and acquisition of their MS/MS spectra. The dynamic mass exclusion was set to 20 sec after the first precursor ion fragmentation. Orbitrap resolution was set to 15000. Normalized AGC target was set to Standard with 40 msec maximum injection time. DIA method covered a mass range from m/z 350 Th up to m/z 1100 Th with 12 Th window width and 1 Th overlap. Orbitrap resolution to 30000. Normalized AGC target was set to 1000% with automatic setting of maximum injection time.",

This study developed a novel targeted LC-MS/MS method with propyl-chloroformate (PCF) derivatization to measure three bioactive peptides\u2014Hydroxyprolyl-glycine (Hyp-Gly), Glycyl-prolyl-hydroxyproline (Gly-Pro-Hyp), and Prolyl-hydroxyproline (Pro-Hyp)\u2014in CHs, with strong correlation coefficients (0.992, 1.000, and 0.995, respectively) and low limits of detection (LODs) of 1.40, 0.14, and 1.16 \u00b5M, respectively. Untargeted Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) analyses measured peptide size distribution, while amino acid analysis assessed nutritional content. Analysis of ten commercial CHs revealed similar amino acid profiles but varied peptide lengths, indicating diverse hydrolysis conditions. Products with higher proportions of smaller peptides showed elevated levels of the targeted bioactive peptides, suggesting that smaller peptide size may increase bioactivity. These findings can inform the optimization of CH supplements, providing consumers with detailed peptide content for more informed choices.",

                "projectDescription": "Reader proteins play significant roles in cell signaling from site-specific lysine methylation, but progress of new reader investigations is rather slow.  Photoreactive crosslinkers enable the discovery of reader proteins, but the chemical synthesis required to optimize the placement of the photoreactive group is laborious. In addition, active intermediates such as nitrene and carbene may cause significant non-specific crosslinking. Here we report dimethylsulfonium as a methyllysine mimic that binds to specific readers and can subsequently crosslink to a conserved tryptophan inside the binding pocket through single electron transfer under UV irradiation. The crosslinking requires \u03c3-\u03c0 electron-donor-acceptor interaction between sulfonium and indole as a key step, facilitating excellent tryptophan site-selectivity and orthogonality to distinct methyllysine readers. Moreover, excited tryptophan without proximate sulfonium leads to minimal non-specific crosslinking from relaxation. This method could escalate the discovery of methyllysine readers from complex cell samples. Furthermore, this photo crosslinking concept could also be expanded to develop more types of microenvironment-dependent conjugations to site-specific tryptophan.",

Next, the peptide probe (50 \u03bcM) and unmodified peptide (500 \u03bcM) were added into the isolated nuclei. Meanwhile, the trimethylated peptide (500 \u03bcM) was added to compete with the probe in control. The mixture was incubated for 20 min followed by irradiation with 302 nm UV light for 5 min on ice. After that, the excess peptide was removed via washing nuclei with the cross-linking buffer twice. Next, the nuclei were resuspended with extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, 0.5 mM DTT, pH 7.5). And the nuclear proteins were extracted through sonication with 8 cycles of a probe sonicator at 20% amplitude for 5 s on and 10 s off. After the removal of any insoluble materials by centrifugation, the nuclear protein was loaded onto pierce streptavidin magnetic beads (Thermo Fisher, 88817), which were blocked and equilibrated with 1 mg/mL BSA and extraction buffer, respectively.

The analytical column was a home-made fused silica capillary column (75 \u00b5m ID, 150 mm length; Upchurch, Oak Harbor, WA) packed with C-18 resin (300 A, 3 \u00b5m, Varian, Lexington, MA). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B consisted of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent acquisition mode using the Xcalibur 4.1 software and there is a single full-scan mass spectrum in the Orbitrap (350-1800 m/z, 60,000 resolution) followed by data-dependent MS/MS scans at 30% normalized collision energy. The AGC target was set as 5e4, and the maximum injection time was 50 ms. Each mass spectrum was analyzed using the Thermo Xcalibur Qual Browser and Proteome Discoverer for the database searching against the Mus musculus proteome database downloaded from UniProtKB (UP000000589) containing 55,311 proteins and the Homo sapiens proteome database downloaded from UniProtKB (UP000005640) containing 80,581 proteins as of September 04, 2023, respectively. The Sequest search parameters included a 10 ppm precursor mass tolerance, 0.02 Da fragment ion tolerance, and up to 2 internal cleavage sites. Fixed modifications included cysteine alkylation\uff0cand the methionine oxidation. Peptides were filtered with 1% false discovery rate (FDR). These values were subsequently adjusted for two-tail t-test. Protein ratios with a ratio greater than 2.0 and a P-value less than 0.05 were considered significant.",

We successfully developed a methylotrophic E. coli strain, SM6, which has a doubling time of 3.5 hours, surpassing the growth rates of typical native methylotrophs. This was achieved through evolutionary engineering that utilized dynamic copy number variation (CNV). The SM6 strain has demonstrated the ability to overcome the issue of formaldehyde-induced DNA-protein cross-linking (DPC) during its evolution, enabling rapid growth in methanol medium. Proteomics are conducted to understand the underlying metabolism / regulation change for the improved growth phenotype.",

The supernatant was collected for protein quantification using 280nm absorbance and a Bradford assay. TMT labeling and peptide fractionation - Proteins were suspended in 8 M urea/50 mM HEPES (pH 8), disulfide bonds were reduced, free thiols were alkylated with iodoacetamide. Afterward, samples were digested overnight at 37\u00b0C using LysC protease and trypsin at an enzyme-to-substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w), and peptides were desalted by using C18 Spin Tips. Eluates were dried by vacuum centrifugation. Desalted peptides were reconstituted in 100 mM HEPES, and TMT18-plex reagents (Thermo Fisher) was added from stocks dissolved in 100 % anhydrous ACN. The peptide-TMT mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with frequently mix, and the labeling reaction was stopped by addition of 5 % hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.4 % and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Labeled peptide mixtures were pooled into 18-plexed sample, which was fractionated into 4 fractions by using high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Pierce). LC-MS/MS measurements - Each fraction was injected for nano-liquid chromatography-nano electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-nanoESI-MS/MS) analysis. NanoLC-nanoESI-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Thermo UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system connected to a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany).

Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water. For SPS-MS3 analysis, the survey scans of peptide precursors from 400 to 1600 m/z were performed at 120K resolution with a 2 \u00d7 10^5 ion count target. Peptide precursors with charge state 2-6 were sampled for MS2. Tandem MS was performed by isolation window at 0.7 Da with the quadrupole, CID fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 30, and MS2 spectra were acquired in the ion trap using an AGC target value of 1 \u00d7 10^4 and the max injection time was 35 ms. Afterwards, MS3 spectra were acquired using synchronous precursor selection (SPS) of 10 isolation notches. MS3 precursors were fragmented by HCD with 55% collision energy and analyzed using the Orbitrap with 50K resolution power at 100-500 m/z scan range, a two m/z isolation window, 1 \u00d7 10^5 AGC, and a maximum injection time of 200 ms with one microscan.",

                "projectDescription": "DNA alkylation at the N2 position of guanine (N2-dG) is a prevalent type of DNA minor-groove lesions arising from various exogenous environmental contaminants and endogenous cellular processes. These N2-alkyl-dG lesions can induce G \u2192 T mutations during transcription if left unrepaired. However, the repair pathways of N2-alkyl-dG lesions remain incompletely elucidated. In this study, we identified a series of potential N2-alkyl-dG-binding proteins utilizing an affinity pulldown coupled with quantitative proteomic approach. We investigated their roles in DNA damage response and repair of these lesions. High-mobility group protein B3 (HMGB3) and activated RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator P15 (SUB1) exhibited preferential binding toward N2-nBudG-containing duplex DNA in quantitative proteomics analysis and in vitro binding assay using recombinant proteins. The presence of HMGB3 and SUB1 protected cells against alkylating agents (e.g., BPDE). Both HMGB3 and SUB1 modulated the repair of N2-nBudG and trans-N2-BPDE-dG in genomic DNA, while HMGB3 wasn\u2019t involved in the repair of cis-N2-BPDE-dG. Together, our findings provided new knowledge about the cellular sensing and repair of minor-groove N2-alkyl-dG lesions.",

The annealed double-stranded DNA was then incubated with high-capacity streptavidin agarose beads (Thermo Pierce) at room temperature with shaking for 60 min. After three washes with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM EDTA to remove any unbound DNA, the DNA-bound beads were incubated with nuclear lysates at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h in the above buffer with 10% glycerol.  The lesion-containing probe and a control lesion-free probe were incubated with heavy and light isotope-labeled lysates, respectively, in forward SILAC experiment. In reverse SILAC experiments, this was reversed. After washing, the beads were combined and the bound proteins were eluted with 1% TFA in CH3CN/H2O (7:3, v/v) at 75 \u00b0C. The eluent was dried in a Speed-vac and subjected to filter-aided sample preparation. Briefly, the dried samples were dissolved in a 400-\uf06dL solution containing 8 M urea and 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) (pH 8.5), transferred to an ultracentrifugal filter (10,000 MWCO, VWR International). After centrifugation at 14,000 g for 3 min, the filter devices were washed twice with 200 \uf06dL of 50 mM ABC to remove urea. After the addition of dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide for cysteine reduction and alkylation, 200 \uf06dL of 50 mM ABC containing 0.8 \uf06dg of trypsin was added to each filter device and the digestion was continued at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h. The digestion mixture was subsequently centrifuged, and the filter device was rinsed with 200 \uf06dL of 50 mM ABC and centrifuged again. The combined filtrates were dried in a Speed-vac, desalted using OMIX C18 Tips (Agilent Technologies), and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS.LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on an EASY-nLC 1200 system coupled with a Q Exactive Plus quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Peptides were eluted using a 180-min linear gradient of 2-40% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) formic acid at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was set up in the positive-ion mode, and the spray voltage was 1.8 kV.

Methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications; cysteine carbamidomethylation was specified as a fixed modification. Mass tolerance for full-scan MS was set as 20 and 4.5 ppm for the first and main search, respectively. The mass tolerance for MS/MS was set at 20 ppm. Two missed cleavages were allowed for trypsin. Peptide spectra were searched against target-decoy Uniprot human proteome database (UP000005640_9606) and the proteins were subsequently filtered at 1% FDR.

                "projectDescription": "Transcription-blocking DNA lesions are specifically targeted by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), which removes a broad spectrum of DNA lesions to preserve transcriptional output and thereby cellular homeostasis to counteract aging. TC-NER is initiated by the stalling of RNA polymerase II at DNA lesions, which triggers the assembly of the TC-NER-specific proteins CSA, CSB and UVSSA. CSA, a WD40-repeat containing protein, is the substrate receptor subunit of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex composed of DDB1, CUL4A/B and RBX1 (CRL4CSA). Although ubiquitination of several TC-NER proteins by CRL4CSA has been reported, it is still unknown how this complex is regulated. To unravel the dynamic molecular interactions and the regulation of this complex, we applied a single-step protein-complex isolation coupled to mass spectrometry analysis and identified DDA1 as a CSA interacting protein. Cryo-EM analysis showed that DDA1 is an integral component of the CRL4CSA complex. Functional analysis revealed that DDA1 coordinates ubiquitination dynamics during TC-NER and is required for efficient turnover and progression of this process.",

Default parameters were applied, including carbamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine set as fixed and variable modifications, respectively. BS3 was selected as the crosslinker. Four miscleavages were allowed for the tryptic digestion, while up to 11 miscleavages were permitted for the sequential proteolytic digests. Additionally, peak refinement was enabled, with peptide-spectrum match (PSM) false discovery rate (FDR) crosslink threshold set at 0.01. Parameters specifying the minimal peptide length and maximal peptide charge were defined as 6 and 8, respectively, with a maximum peptide mass set to 6000 Da. Subsequently, crosslink networks were visualized employing XINET and XIVIEW.",

Here, we determined that P. gingivalis infection mediates therapeutic resistance via inhibiting lethal mitophagy in cancer cells and tumors. Mechanistically, P. gingivalis targets the LC3B-ceramide complex by associating with LC3B via bacterial major fimbriae (FimA) protein, preventing ceramide-dependent mitophagy in response to various therapeutic agents. Moreover, ceramide-mediated mitophagy is induced by Annexin A2 (ANXA2)-ceramide association, involving the E142 residue of ANXA2. Inhibition of ANXA2-ceramide-LC3B complex formation by wild-type P. gingivalis prevented ceramide-dependent mitophagy. Moreover, a FimA-deletion mutant P. gingivalis variant had no inhibitory effects on ceramide-dependent mitophagy. Further, 16S rRNA sequencing of oral tumors indicated that P. gingivalis infection altered the microbiome of the tumor macroenvironment in response to ceramide analog treatment in mice. Thus, these data provide a mechanism describing the pro-survival roles of P. gingivalis in oral tumors.",
                "sampleProcessingProtocol": "Lysate or immunoprecipitated was run on a 4-12% polyacrylamide gel and then stained with Coomassie blue dye according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Safe Coomassie Brilliant Blue #1610786). For better visualization of faint bands, silver staining was conducted following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (ThermoFisher Pierce Silver Stain Kit # 24612). Gel bands of interest were selected, excised, and placed in a microcentrifuge tube. Gel bands were washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 10 minutes.  Next, the plugs were de-stained using 25mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile for 15 minutes, repeated twice.  The bands were then reduced with DTT (Sigma) and alkylated using 55mM Iodoacetamide (Sigma). The gel plugs were then washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 10 minutes.  The plugs were dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile for 15 minutes and dried in a speedvac.  Each gel plug was covered with 100ng Proteomics Grade Trypsin (Sigma) and incubated at 37C overnight. The supernatant was collected in a clean dry Eppendorf tube.  Peptides were further extracted with 1 wash of 25mM ammonium bicarbonate for 20 minutes and three washes of 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile for 20 minutes each.  The supernatant was collected after each wash then dried down in a speedvac to ~1 uL. Samples were reconstituted in 7 uL of mobile phase A (95% water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.2% formic acid) and placed in autosampler vials.Peptides separated and analyzed on an EASY nLC 1200 System (ThermoScientific) in-line with the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (ThermoScientific) with instrument control software v. 4.2.28.14.  Two \u00b5g of tryptic peptides are pressure loaded onto C18 reversed phase column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 75 \u00b5m x 50 cm (C18, 2 \u00b5m, 100 \u00c5) ThermoFisher cat. # 164536) using a gradient of 5% to 40% B in 60 min (Solvent A: 5% acetonitrile/ 0.2% formic acid; Solvent B: 80% acetonitrile/ 0.2% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.    Mass spectra are acquired in data-dependent mode with a high resolution (60,000) FTMS survey scan, mass range of m/z 375-1575, followed by tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) of the most intense precursors with a cycle time of 3 s.  The automatic gain control target value is 4.0e6 for the survey MS scan.  Monoisotopic-precursor selection was set to \u201cpeptide\u201d.  HCD fragmentation is performed with a precursor isolation window of 1.6 m/z, a maximum injection time of 100 ms, and HCD collision energy of 35%. Precursors within 10 ppm mass tolerance are dynamically excluded from resequencing for 10 sec.    Advanced peak determination was enabled.  Precursor ions with charge states that were 2-7 were included.",
                "dataProcessingProtocol": "The raw data are searched with Proteome Discoverer 1.4. Data was searched against a human database and Porphryomona_gingivalis database. Variable modification of methionine oxidation were included. Static  cysteine modification for carbamidomethyl are also included. Up to 2 missed cleavages are allowed with trypsin selected as the enzyme. Protein identifications were filtered to have an Xcorr vs charge state  > 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 for +1, +2, and +3 ions, with at least 2 unique peptides matching the protein, 10ppm peptide mass accuracy, and 0.8Da fragment ion mass accuracy to be considered a positive identification.",
