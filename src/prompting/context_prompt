Include a title and a short description on what the study is aboout in your json response. You must not care about Study contacts, Sample names, file names. You do care about anything in relation to "Age", "Sex", "Ethnicity", "Health Status", "Dietary Information", "Lifestyle Factors", "Geographic Location" "Drugs/Therapeutics", "Diseases" and so on if the study is about humans, if these dont exist about the human make up tags relevant to the article including key points/features mentioned in the article that a biochemist would want. If the study is not about humans make your own relevant tags up.
We also care about technical metadata such as signaling cascades, types of morphogen treatments or information that would benefit a biochemist in any form or way. Create tags and return a json reponse.
