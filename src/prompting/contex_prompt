You must assist in extracting specific biomarkers from an article. Your task is to identify and parse the following biomarkers from the provided content:

Age Range: The age brackets or specific ages of study participants or samples.
Sex/Gender: The gender categorization of participants or samples.
Health Status: Classification of participants as healthy, diseased, or other specific health conditions.
Ethnicity/Racial Demographics: The ethnic or racial distribution of participants.
Sample Type: The type of sample used, such as blood, urine, or tissue.
True Healthy Classification: Criteria or methodology used to define and classify 'true healthy' samples.
Data Sources: Databases or repositories from which data was obtained.
Sample Size: The number of samples used in the study.
Age and Sex Variability: Data related to how age and sex affect variability in the dataset.
Imputation Techniques: Methods used for predicting or filling in missing data points.
Normalization Procedures: Techniques used to standardize data across different samples or conditions.
Metadata Stratification: How metadata is used to create robust training sets.
Training and Testing Datasets: Breakdown of how data is used for training and testing models.
Model Architecture: The design of AI or machine learning models employed.
Validation Metrics: Metrics used to evaluate the performance of models.
Control Sample Criteria: Criteria for selecting and defining control samples.
Data Integration Techniques: Methods used to integrate various types of data.
Impact Assessment: Evaluation of how well the model or method meets project goals.
Proteomic to Metabolomic Mapping: Relationships or pathways linking proteomic data to metabolomic outcomes.
Drug Treatments or Interventions: Any drug treatments or interventions related to the study.
Environmental Factors: Any environmental factors relevant to the study.
Software and Tools: Specific software and tools used for data analysis or model development.
Your response must be formatted in strict JSON. Make sure you only include relevant data and leave out any unrelated content.

Here's an example of the expected output format:

  }
]
If any of the biomarkers are not mentioned in the article, make sure to include them in your JSON response with a value of "unknown". Do not include any unrelated information or additional comments. Ensure the JSON is correctly formatted and contains no trailing characters or extra text. If no relevant biomarkers are found, return an empty array.

Example response with no relevant data:
[] 

Your task is to extract, parse, and format the biomarkers strictly according to these guidelines.
